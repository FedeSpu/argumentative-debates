49;1.1.3.2.3;pro;Currently, Europol is losing its fight against money laundering and other such crimes. A more unified task force would consolidate efforts to amend this.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '1']; ;4
50;1.1.3.3;pro;At present, a lot of public spending is duplicated: from spending in research (where different national states may replicate the same experiments) to spending in diplomatic representation (each national state has its own embassy in a non-member state).

59;1.1.5.2;pro;EU needs to have more leverage to impose common European solutions and not to be blocked in every decision it takes. Of course, the USE won't make everyone happy each and every time, but that's a reality each nation state faces.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '1']; 4;3

91;1.1.7.2.10;con;Separatist movements are often rooted in historical oppression, regardless of whether or not there's any legitimate oppression happening today.
