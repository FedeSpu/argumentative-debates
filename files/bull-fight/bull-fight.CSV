1;1.1;pro;Bullfighting, as a male-dominated sport, reinforces harmful gender stereotypes.;['38', '23', '20', '11', '17']; 18;1
2;1.1.1;pro;Historically, women have been left out of bullfighting as active subjects. Participation in the practice has been forbidden for women in different times throughout Spanish history.;['1', '5', '14', '6', '1']; 6;2
3;1.1.1.1;pro;For centuries, women could only be eye-candy for male spectators or the bullfighter's suffering mother or wife (p. 36).;['1', '3', '8', '7', '2']; 4;3
4;1.1.1.2;pro;In the first volumes of the Cossío (the most important bullfighting encyclopaedia, which continues to be updated and revised) out of 4,125 pages, only 11 are dedicated to women and only under comical shows, ignoring pioneers like Conchita Cintrón or Juanita Cruz (p. 3-4).;['1', '3', '7', '9', '1']; 17;3

6;1.1.2;pro;The town of Astorga promoted a bullfighting festivity in honour of “the Spanish Women”, in which women (and children under 8) could enter for free, as long as they went with someone holding a ticket (a man). This is an initiative that equates women to children and uses them as a tactic to increase attendance.;['2', '13', '6', '6', '1']; 13;2
7;1.1.3;pro;When the Indian Supreme Court banned jallikattu (bullfighting) in Tamil Nadu, animal rights activists like Tamil actress Trisha faced misogynist attacks by fans. The male actors who took a similar stand were not targeted by the protesters.;['2', '9', '9', '3', '4']; 14;2
8;1.1.3.1;con;This may have nothing to do with bullfighting specifically, as high-profile women who take public stances on political issues generally receive substantial amounts of abuse and threats.;['1', '1', '6', '0', '0']; ;3
9;1.1.3.1.1;con;The issues where women face mysoginist attacks are generally those where there is a masculinity ethos, i.e., those where qualities such as strenght are valued over ethical qualities like kindness and compassion. Therefore, even though it is very common to see this kind of attack happening in many issues, bullfighting seems to be prone to this kind of attack.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;4
10;1.1.4;con;Bullfighting could easily become more inclusive for women in the future. The current situation is no reason to outright ban the sport.;['0', '7', '11', '3', '1']; 4;2

12;1.1.4.1.2;con;Female bullfighters - such as Beatriz Romero, Joaquina Ariza or Cristina Sánchez - have proved their mastery in the arena, yet they have endured sexism in the form of fewer bookings, less payment, and less recognition, among other issues.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 4;4
13;1.1.4.2;pro;For example, in Portugal, there are two parts of the bullfight, one where the bullfighter on a horse puts some kind of sticks in the bull, the other where the 'forcados' stop the bull by immobilizing him. In the first category there are many famous female bullfighters and almost always is there a woman fighting, in the second, there is less representation, but there are female groups of 'forcados'.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 4;3

15;1.1.6;con;There are no separate categories for men and women in bullfighting.;['2', '10', '8', '3', '4']; ;2
16;1.1.6.1;con;This might well be a result of the absence of women in the sport. Where there are no women, there is no need for a separate category of women's bullfighting.;['1', '3', '10', '6', '0']; ;3
17;1.1.6.1.1;con;If there are no women in the sport, the cause of that should be questioned. It may be driven by hostility of the sport towards women, or a lack of opportunities being provided to women to participate.;['0', '1', '3', '4', '0']; ;4

21;1.1.7.1.1.1;pro;Indeed, in the case of sychronised swimming, men were equally involved at its onset, before the genders were separated for modesty reasons, and lack of participant interest in the male league led to its collapse.;['0', '1', '4', '3', '0']; ;5

27;1.1.8.1.1;con;Sports such as baseball do not rely on inherently violent or otherwise morally problematic activities. This is why trailblazers can inspire future generations.

59;1.2.3.2;pro;The risk and danger are an integral form of what makes bullfighting appealing as an art form.

831;1.8.1.1;pro;Bullfighting occurs naturally. If a man were to encounter a bull alone in a field, the bull would charge and try to kill the man. Man has taken this and created an artistic event that emphasizes valor while giving the spectator a perspective on the tragedy of life. It is theater where the protagonists risk their lives. It should be appreciated more.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 11;3
832;1.8.1.1.1;con;"Bullfighting is not a natural occurrence but an organized practice. Selective breeding has maintained or augmented the aggression of the bull.

839;1.8.2.4;con;An activity being good for the physical health of one who practices it, does not justify that activity being legal or encouraged.
