1.1. Pro: Access to legal abortion improves the health and safety of women.
1.1.1. Pro: Pregnancy and childbirth can be gruelling and have huge and varying impacts on women’s physical and mental wellbeing.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Abortion has [less physical impact](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049386715001589?via%3Dihub) on people than pregnancy does.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Women who get abortions are less likely to have complications than people who have their [wisdom teeth](http://time.com/3623572/abortion-safe-complications/) removed.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: In rare cases, abortions can cause dangerous and potentially life-threatening [complications](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/abortion/risks/), such as infection of the womb, some of the pregnancy remaining in the womb, excessive bleeding, damage to the cervix, or damage to the womb.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: It's still good to keep them legal because legal abortions are safer than illegal abortions.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Illegal abortions have huge risks associated with them.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Dr. Bernhard Nathanson [testified](https://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/11/03/how-abortion-movement-started-deceit-and-lies-dr-nathanson)(In NARAL \(National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws\) we generally emphasized the drama of the individual case, not the mass statistics, but when we spoke of the latter it was always 5,000 to 10,000 a year. I confess that I knew the figures were totally false, but in the "morality" of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics?' The official figures of maternal death due to illegal abortion before abortion was legalised was 160.) that the pro-choice movement has grossly inflated the statistics on maternal deaths due to illegal abortion.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: The methods used by women when they are unable to legally have an abortion are very unsafe. This can lead to infection, internal injuries, toxic shock, and a range of other medical complications.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: The methods used in illegal abortions often include the use of a [sharp objec](https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2013/07/13/anatomy-of-a-coat-hanger-abortion/)t to break the amniotic sac to induce an abortion, the use of [abortifacients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortifacient), and pumping [toxic mixtures](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7328830.stm) inside a women's body.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: [25%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/) of the women who survive unsafe abortion suffer long-term health complications \(5 million out of 19,932,000\).
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.3. Con: The solution is to educate women about the risks of unsafe self-abortions so that they not attempted at all.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.3.1. Con: This does not address the source of the problem.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.4. Pro: An estimated [100,000-240,000](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abortion-usa-texas-doityourself/up-against-strict-laws-texas-women-learn-do-it-yourself-abortions-idUSKCN0YF1BC) Texas women have self-induced abortions \(most commonly with [black market misoprostol/Cytotec](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/the-rise-of-the-diy-abortion-in-texas/373240/)\) since restrictive abortion laws that forced the closing of many Texas abortion clinics were passed in 2013.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: [Nearly 70,000 women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/) die and [7 million develop dangerous complications](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs388/en/) every year because they aren't able to access a safe and legal abortion.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: In Romania, [more than 9,000 women died](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/15/abortion-romanian-history) between 1965 and 1989 due to complications with illegal abortions. This was under Ceausescu's rule and at a time when access to abortion was extremely limited.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Legalised abortion furthermore has a great impact on reducing maternal mortality, as seen in Romania after the liberalization of abortion in 1989 \([p. 20](https://www.gapminder.org/documentation/documentation/gapdoc010.pdf)\).
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.2. Con: The WHO estimates [40-50 million annual abortions](https://www.worldometers.info/abortions/). Each adult life would have to be worth over 7142 fetuses for the above claim to be valid.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Fetuses are merely potential at best, making them inherently worth less than actual people.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.2.2. Con: The fewer abortions there are, the more women there are who would die from childbirth. The adult life being worth 7,000 fetuses is an unfair comparison because women making it without harm isn't recorded, whereas abortions are.
1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Many of these can also happen when giving birth to a child.
1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Some of the pregnancy remaining isn't only an issue with abortion. [The placenta can be retained after birth](http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-complications/retained-placenta/) and cause health problems.
1.1.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Damage to the cervix can happen while giving birth. The [cervix](http://hetv.org/resources/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Repair_cervical_P81.html) and [vagina](https://www.babycenter.com/0_perineal-tears_1451354.bc) can tear.
1.1.1.2. Pro: [Pregnancy symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregcomplications.htm) can be severe and can involve life-threatening illnesses.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: In these instances, it is possible to make exceptions to the law without outright making abortion a legal choice.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Trying to sort out the exceptions from the general rule \(especially if this is an exception wherein all other abortion is illegal and not merely, say, 3rd trimester or post-viability abortions\) would require extensive, unjustified government invasion into the woman's privacy.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Enforcing laws and drawing lines between what is legal and illegal is often a long process, prone to mistakes. Abortion is a time-delicate matter which cannot be postponed for next hearing.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: By definition, preventing abortion is [torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture). It punishes people for getting pregnant and forces them to give birth, all with a painful process.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Preventing abortion is not torture because actual torturers intend to inflict as much pain as possible on their victim and do not care about preserving human life, whereas pro-lifers are motivated by a desire to preserve human life, and also want to minimize the pain of pregnancy, childhood, and motherhood as much as possible. This is why [they set up](https://www.focusonthefamily.com/pro-life/alternatives-to-abortion-pregnancy-resource-centers/) [pregnancy resource centers](https://www.pregnancyresourcecenter.org/) to help women with unplanned pregnancies.
1.1.1.2.3. Con: Fathers-to-be experience [hormonal](https://www.nicswell.co.uk/health-news/fathers-to-be-experience-hormone-changes) changes during pregnancy as well.
1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: Fathers will still never feel the physical effects of childbirth in the way mothers do.
1.1.1.2.3.2. Con: The small [hormonal](https://www.webmd.com/men/news/20141217/expectant-dads-may-also-have-hormonal-changes-study-suggests) changes in men during pregnancy cannot be compared to the drastic changes women's bodies have to go through.
1.1.1.2.4. Pro: The hormonal and psychological shifts that occur during pregnancy put some women at an increased risk for [mental illnesses](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/18/pregnancy-affects-mental-health_n_6343186.html), such as anxiety and depression.
1.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: [Many women](http://postpartumprogress.org/the-facts-about-postpartum-depression/) suffer from postpartum depression.
1.1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: Many women who have abortions suffer a lifetime of [depression and guilt](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/199/3/180) as a result of terminating their pregnancies.
1.1.1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: US [researchers](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/health/abortion-mental-health.html) followed nearly 1,000 women who sought abortions nationwide for five years and found that those who had abortions did not experience more depression, anxiety, low self-esteem or dissatisfaction with life than those who were denied it.
1.1.1.2.4.1.1.2. Con: 95% of women who have had abortions do not regret their decision to terminate their [pregnancies](http://time.com/3956781/women-abortion-regret-reproductive-health/).
1.1.1.2.4.1.1.2.1. Con: This 95% statistic is based on one study and biased reporting. Here is an [article](http://www.jcrtl.org/post-abortion-syndrome.html) that shows 40 to 60% have negative reactions and 31% regret it.
1.1.1.2.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Post-abortion syndrome [has not been validated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_and_mental_health#Post-abortion_syndrome) as a discrete psychiatric condition and is not recognized.
1.1.1.2.4.1.2. Pro: This is [especially true in women](http://www.postpartumprogress.com/postpartum-depression-risk-factors-2) who miscarry or in cases where the child is stillborn or has such a severe illness that it does not live for very long.
1.1.1.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: Depression after a [miscarriage](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/miscarriage-depression#2) is usually most severe immediately after a pregnancy is lost. In one [study](https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282\(08\)04743-2/abstract), researchers discovered that after a year, women who had a miscarriage experienced rates of depression similar to those of women who didn’t have a miscarriage.
1.1.1.2.4.1.2.2. Con: If a stillborn child or child that doesn't live for very long causes an increased risk of depression, then a child terminated in the womb would cause an even greater increase of risk of depression.
1.1.1.2.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: A [study](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/199/3/180) in the British Journal of Psychiatry found that women had a 37% higher risk of depression due to abortion compared to term birth. Stillbirth only has an [11%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC31099/) higher depression risk compared to term birth and it declines over time.
1.1.1.2.4.1.2.3. Con: A miscarriage or stillborn baby is 100% dead \(or non-living, depending on your view\). If a mother fears for this outcome of their fetus, an abortion should also be feared because it confirms the death of the fetus. However, if the mother chooses not to have an abortion, the chances of the fetus surviving birth is non-zero.
1.1.1.2.4.1.2.3.1. Con: There are cases where an abortion would be for the best even when the mother wants the child. [This ban on abortion](https://www.texastribune.org/2016/04/03/austin-couple-abortion-restrictions-led-stillborn-/) caused a mother serious psychological trauma by forcing her to feel her baby die in her for 3 days before being able to get a stillborn removed. Abortion in this case was the more humane option.
1.1.1.2.4.1.3. Con: Society doesn't give depressed mothers the right to kill their infants or toddlers, so depression in and of itself is not an ethically justifiable reason to terminate life.
1.1.1.2.4.1.3.1. Con: [Postpartum depression](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/post-natal-depression/) affects 1 in 10 women, and is especially common in circumstances where the mother has a history of mental health problems. As depression is a serious and potentially life-threatening mental illness, these concerns can be a fair and legitimate factor when deciding whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.
1.1.1.2.4.1.3.1.1. Con: While postpartum depression is common, the risk of self-harm comes from [postpartum psychosis](https://familydoctor.org/condition/postpartum-depression/) which is more rare. The postpartum suicide rate is less than 2 out of every 100,000 births. This is [around the same risk](http://www.postpartumprogress.com/pregnancy-and-suicide) as the mother dying from hemorrhage/placenta previa or eclampsia/pre-eclampsia.
1.1.1.2.4.1.3.1.2. Con: [Screening questionnaires](http://www.postpartum.net/learn-more/screening/), [doctor follow-ups](https://familydoctor.org/condition/postpartum-depression/), and [local resources](http://www.postpartum.net/get-help/locations/) greatly mitigate the risks of a women with postpartum psychosis committing suicide.
1.1.1.2.4.1.3.1.3. Con: As society does not consider it morally permissible to allow mothers with known depression to kill their infant children, it would be even less morally permissible for a mother to kill an unborn child on the sole basis of potential future depression.
1.1.1.2.4.1.4. Con: Depression is only a possible post-birth complication, not a guaranteed outcome.
1.1.1.2.4.2. Con: Abortion causes the death of the fetus and death is more severe than anxiety or depression.
1.1.1.2.4.2.1. Con: [Restrictions on abortion services have been associated with increased infant and increased maternal mortality risk](https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fijerph17113773)(Multilevel logistic regression was used on data for 11,972,629 infants and mothers from the US Cohort Linked Birth/Infant Death Data Files 2008–2010 to determine whether type or number of state-level restrictive abortion laws during year of birth were associated with odds of infant mortality.\n\nCompared to infants living in states with no restrictive laws, infants living in states with one or two restrictive laws \(adjusted odds ratio \(AOR\) = 1.08; 95% confidence interval \[CI\] = 0.99–1.18\) and those living in states with 3 to 5 restrictive laws \(AOR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.01–1.20\) were more likely to die. Separate analyses examining the relationship between parental involvement laws and infant mortality risk, stratified by maternal age, indicated that significant associations were observed among mothers aged ≤19 years \(AOR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.00–1.19\), and 20 to 25 years \(AOR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.03–1.17\).), which is more severe for both the mother and the birthed infant than an early first trimester abortion.
1.1.1.2.5. Pro: Child-birth is a dangerous and complicated medical procedure.
1.1.1.2.5.1. Pro: Even in developed nations, with world class health care systems, there is still a [non-zero](https://www.varsity.co.uk/science/8644) chance that individuals may die whilst giving birth. Women who are under the age of 15, older mothers, and women from lower income groups are particularly at risk.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1. Con: The “non-zero” argument suggests that, since we cannot attain a perfect situation \(e.g. perfect birthing surgery\), we may as well accept the potential consequences of bad situations \(e.g. miscarriages\) and not act to reduce those consequences. This implies that we should give up anything where perfection is unlikely to be attained.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: For example, we may as well give up cars because the chances of having an accident is non-zero.
1.1.1.2.5.1.1.2. Con: Nobody is claiming that childbirth in general isn't worth it due to risk of death. The key point here is allowing the woman to have the choice to bear that risk, or not to.
1.1.1.2.5.1.2. Pro: As long as the risk of death during childbirth remains non-zero, it is unethical to force a person to continue their pregnancy.
1.1.1.2.5.1.3. Pro: In the U.S., [approximately two to three women die in childbirth every day](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/22/572298802/nearly-dying-in-childbirth-why-preventable-complications-are-growing-in-u-s).
1.1.1.2.5.2. Pro: Even under ideal medical supervision each case can be [potentially lethal to women](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/complications-cesarean-section#complications). No one can be forced to undergo a risky medical procedure. Some women know that they will have complications. They can't be forced to risk their lives.
1.1.1.2.5.2.1. Pro: There are many common types of [pregnancy complications](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/pregnancy/conditioninfo/complications).
1.1.1.2.5.2.2. Pro: In the US, [6 to 8%](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/high-risk_pregnancy/) of pregnancies are high risk.
1.1.1.2.5.3. Con: Most births aren't that complicated. Child birth has been ongoing since time immemorial.
1.1.1.2.5.3.1. Con: Abortions have also been [ongoing for centuries, if not millennia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_abortion)
1.1.1.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: [The Bruce effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_effect) is a type of abortion that exists in nature.
1.1.1.2.6. Pro: The health risks associated with a late abortion, are still [less](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/10015#.WhrwQEpl86w) than the health risks associated with childbirth.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Women's bodies change significantly as a result of pregnancy. Many women may feel less attractive because of the [stretch marks](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-survey-highlights-negative-impact-of-stretch-marks-on-womens-body-image-300636141.html) and weight gain.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: There is an increasing trend in [positivity](https://www.theloop.ca/stretch-marks-are-the-new-beauty-marks-and-we-couldnt-be-happier-about-it/) towards stretch marks.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: While pregnancy can take a toll on the body, the woman can work to minimize this and [recover](https://www.verywellfamily.com/what-are-stretch-marks-and-how-can-i-get-rid-of-them-2759982) to some degree.
1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: There's no reason a woman should be required to deal with this toll in the first place.
1.1.1.4. Con: Nursing an infant is gruelling and takes a [huge toll on the body](https://www.romper.com/p/how-does-breastfeeding-affect-your-energy-levels-experts-explain-19442127)(In addition to the amount of calories you're burning zapping you of energy, sleep deprivation does play a role, of course.\n\n“Breastfeeding may disrupt your sleep, and that can also affect energy levels — however, the reality is that having a baby disrupts sleep regardless of how it is fed," Andrea Tran, a registered nurse and IBCLC, tells Romper.\n\n“Exclusive pumping can actually be more draining for moms than exclusive breastfeeding, as there are more steps to take,” Hamilton explains.), yet society doesn't treat that as an ethical excuse for the mother to kill the infant.
1.1.1.4.1. Con: The situations are not comparable. A nursing mother can raise her child with the help of infant formula or a wet nurse.
1.1.1.5. Con: The overall mental hardships of going through an abortion are more [severe](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/abortion-and-mental-health-quantitative-synthesis-and-analysis-of-research-published-19952009/E8D556AAE1C1D2F0F8B060B28BEE6C3D) than those of just being pregnant.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.1.1.1.
1.1.1.5.2. Con: The mental hardships of pregnancy and the mental hardships of abortion are different for different people. Thus, women should be able to choose, based on their own needs.
1.1.1.5.3. Pro: A 2003 [study](https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006254-200301000-00023) found an increased risk of preterm delivery and mood disorders, such as depression, in women with previous abortions as compared to women who had not had previous abortions.
1.1.1.5.4. Pro: A 2007 [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.02040.x) found that women who aborted had an increased risk of later substance abuse or dependance than women who gave birth.
1.1.1.5.5. Pro: A [study](http://A study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry found that women who aborted had an 81% increased risk of mental disorders due to abortion, with 10% of that risk able to be directly related to the effects of abortion as compared to women who went to term and the other 71% correlative.) published in the British Journal of Psychiatry found that women who aborted had an 81% increased risk of mental disorders due to abortion, with 10% of that risk able to be directly related to the effects of abortion as compared to women who went to term and the other 71% correlative.
1.1.1.5.5.1. Pro: The [study](https://lagunatreatment.com/support-for-women/mental-health-abortion/) showed women who get an abortion are 34% more likely to develop an anxiety disorder, 37% more likely to experience depression, 110% more likely to abuse alcohol, 155% more likely to commit suicide and 220% more likely to abuse marijuana.
1.1.1.5.5.2. Con: Several researchers and the editor of the Journal found that there were [serious issues](https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2012/study-purporting-show-link-between-abortion-and-mental-health-outcomes-decisively) with methodology and analysis.
1.1.1.5.5.3. Con: This study does not distinguish between mental health outcomes that occurred before abortions and those that occurred afterward, but still claimed to show a causal link between abortion and mental disorders.
1.1.1.5.5.4. Con: Negative emotional and psychological experiences after abortion are often linked to the individual's [own views](http://americanpregnancy.org/unplanned-pregnancy/abortion-emotional-effects/) about whether a fetus is a life from the point of conception. This suggests that people will have very different reactions to abortion depending on their beliefs, and reaffirms the view that it is therefore best for women determine the right choice for them.
1.1.2. Con: When abortion is easily available, it incentivises irresponsible behaviour.
1.1.2.1. Pro: When access to abortion is easy and cheap, abortion is more likely to be viewed as a legitimate form of contraception or as a fallback option, rather than encouraging the use of preventative contraception such as condoms and the pill.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Abortions often require a number of doctors visits and a medical procedure. They are therefore unlikely to be viewed as a legitimate contraceptive option when other forms of contraception are more simple and accessible.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Birth control pills have continuous physical and mental [side effects](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/290196.php) that can burden women who choose to use them. Some women might consider abortion to be a better option than deal with the side effects on an almost daily basis.
1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The birth control pill has to be taken at the same time daily and pregnancy rates increase dramatically in women who miss a pill \(rates rise 30-80 times, according to the [ARHP](http://www.arhp.org/Publications-and-Resources/Patient-Resources/fact-sheets/Successful-Contraception)\).
1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Being pregnant has many [similar and often more severe](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/in-depth/symptoms-of-pregnancy/art-20043853) side effects, so for most women, it is unlikely that repeatedly getting pregnant and having abortions would actually be a better experience.
1.1.2.1.1.1.3. Con: Unless there are numbers to support this, it is pure speculation.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: In many countries without strong state support for family planning services, doctors might be more inclined towards the lucrative work of performing abortions over the prescription of birth control - as was the case in [Romania](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/21/world/romania-s-communist-legacy-abortion-culture.html) throughout the 1990s.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The possibility of doctors being corrupt and state not having strong family planning services support are not variables that should come into play when deciding general legality of abortion. They circumvent the fundamental "right to abortion" issue by blaming external factors.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: The state has the ultimate power over the availability of abortions and contraceptives. Therefore it is [up to the state](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473035/)(What makes abortion safe is simple and irrefutable—when it is available on the woman’s request and is universally affordable and accessible. From this perspective, few existing laws are fit for purpose.) to promote contraception and family planning over abortions.
1.1.2.1.4. Pro: A 2016 [paper](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/public-health/abortion-birth-control-substitute) on Nepal’s legalisation of abortion provides evidence of true substitution between use of modern contraceptives and abortion. It showed that each new legal abortion provider in a woman’s district of residence was associated with a 2.6 percent decrease in the likelihood of using modern contraception.
1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: The same study goes on to argue that policies looking to reduce the cost of abortion should also look to reduce the cost of contraception, as a reduction in contraceptive cost may reduce the need for abortions.
1.1.2.1.4.2. Con: This substitution seems to require holding ease of access to contraceptives constant. Thus, if we as a society decide that using abortion as birth control is bad, we can keep that practice rare by increasing access to birth control at the same time that we increase access to abortion.
1.1.2.1.5. Con: The fall-back option is often the [morning-after pill](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/plan-b). It is highly unlikely that "in the moment" anyone would consider that they will just get an abortion if they happen to get pregnant.
1.1.2.1.6. Con: You cannot deprive the vast majority of legitimate users of abortion just because some will use it as a form of contraception.
1.1.2.1.7. Con: Abortion is considered a serious enough procedure that people are unlikely to rely on it as a form of birth control.
1.1.2.1.7.1. Con: There are [testimonials](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/02/abortion-as-birth-control/459960/) of people claiming they use abortion as a form of birth control. Regardless of how seriously doctors take abortion, people are often ignorant or choose to ignore the risks.
1.1.2.1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.2.1.7.3. Pro: The [impact](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/193/6/444) an abortion has on the temporary mental health of a women is evidence to show that it is not something taken lightly because the repercussions are quite intense. Hence, it is very unlikely that abortion access will increase irresponsible behaviour.
1.1.2.1.7.4. Con: A majority of abortions are done out of convenience \(i.e. [inconvenient timing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/3243347/) or circumstances\).
1.1.2.2. Con: Improved access to abortions does not prevent women from behaving responsibly. Societies which grant women abortion rights almost always stress the importance of behaving responsibly when having sex, for example, by strongly encouraging norms of wearing condoms to prevent STDs.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: It is unclear why access to abortion would necessarily lead to more promiscuity than access to contraception more generally does, as people now have far greater control over their reproductive capacities.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: It will always be easier and cheaper to use a condom than to undergo an abortion.
1.1.2.3. Con: There is no evidence that abortion access makes women engage in more irresponsible behaviour.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: The access to abortion [incentivises promiscuity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15457623), which [causes](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201304/the-lingering-psychological-effects-multiple-sex-partners) alcohol or substance abuse, as well as it increasing anxiety and depression. This is especially prominent in women.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: One study found that increasing the costs of abortion, such as necessitating parental involvement, is more likely to lead to teenagers engaging in safer sex, or even abstinence \([p. 19](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1495&context=faculty_scholarship)\).
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: Countries in which abortion is available have [similar abortion rates](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/women-in-countries-where-abortion-is-illegal-just-as-likely-to-have-one-as-countries-where-it-is-a7025671.html) to countries in which abortion is illegal.
1.1.2.3.3.1. Con: It could be that abortion legality by itself leads to more abortions, but other differences between the types of countries that ban abortions and those that allow it counteract this effect.
1.1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: Countries that ban abortions may also [restrict](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/women-countries-where-abortion-illegal-just-likely-have-one-countries-where-it-legal-study-concludes-a7025671.html) contraception, which could lead to an increase in unplanned pregnancies and abortions.
1.1.2.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: Much of the abortion restriction around the world is due to Catholic influence, yet Catholicism also condemns contraception.
1.1.2.3.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Central and South America and parts of Africa are both [heavily Catholic](https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/mar/05/world-map-catholic-population) and have [strict abortion restrictions](https://maps.reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws).
1.1.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: Poorer countries [tend](https://maps.reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws) to ban abortion. Since [economic factors](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2005/reasons-us-women-have-abortions-quantitative-and-qualitative-perspectives)(In 1987, a survey of 1,900 women at large abortion providers across the country found that women's most common reasons for having an abortion were that having a baby would interfere with school, work or other responsibilities, and that they could not afford a child.4 Since 1987, little research in this area has been conducted in the United States, but studies done in Scandinavia and worldwide have found several recurring motivations: economic hardship, partner difficulties and unreadiness for parenting.) can contribute to the decision to have an abortion, this poverty could be inflating the number of abortions in countries that ban it.
1.1.2.3.3.2. Con: According to [Henshaw 2009](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/restrictions-medicaid-funding-abortions-literature-review#)(Approximately one-fourth of women who would have Medicaid-funded abortions instead give\nbirth when this funding is unavailable.\n• Medicaid restrictions lead to a reduction in the proportion of teenage pregnancies that end in\nabortion, but the long-term effect on the birthrate is less clear.), restricting Medicaid funding for abortions reduces the abortion rate.
1.1.2.3.3.3. Pro: There is an association between unsafe abortion and restrictive abortion laws. Abortion-related [deaths](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/figure/F1/) are more frequent in countries with more restrictive abortion [laws](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/figure/F2/) than in countries with less restrictive laws.
1.1.2.3.3.4. Pro: Comparing [OECD countries](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.ADO.TFRT) with and without legal abortion shows that legalisation of abortion does not lead to irresponsible behaviour, while allowing more self determination.
1.1.2.3.4. Pro: If we consider this a valid argument, then we should also consider that healthcare makes people take bad food choices, and we should not provide treatment for those who get sick consciously.
1.1.2.3.5. Con: This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15457623/) argues that there is a link between access to abortion and increased sexual activity, which was also linked to an increase in STDs.
1.1.2.3.5.1. Con: Relationships to abortion and other behaviours may exist, but have not been tested.
1.1.2.3.5.2. Con: Sexual intercourse is a normal human function. It is not irresponsible behavior.
1.1.2.3.5.2.1. Con: A normal consequence of sexual intercourse is pregnancy. Having sex \(especially unprotected sex\) disregarding consequences of the act is the very definition of "irresponsible behavior".
1.1.2.3.5.3. Con: The study showed only an association, not direct causation. The data was used to support a previously made hypothesis, not to develop a hypothesis from observed behaviour.
1.1.2.3.5.4. Con: While there is indeed a rise of gonorrhoea cases in America starting 1970, there had also been a[precipitous drop in syphilis cases](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/04/14/986997576/once-on-the-brink-of-eradication-syphilis-is-raging-again)(In 2000, syphilis rates were so low that public health officials believed eradication was on the horizon.) in the same period, which contradicts that study.
1.1.2.4. Pro: People having sex must be repsonsible given the likelihood that they may get pregnant. Abortion may cause people to be less cautious.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: No contraception is perfect, so it is the responsibility of the couple to plan for sex and use contraception if they need. Abortion should not be seen as a "bail-out" from a mistake.
1.1.2.4.2. Con: No form of contraception is 100% effective.
1.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Even used perfectly, condoms are only effective [98%](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms) of the time.
1.1.2.4.2.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood states that the pill is only about [91%](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms) effective because it is difficult to maintain perfect use.
1.1.2.4.2.2.1. Con: If the pill is used perfectly, it is 99% [effective](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/how-effective-contraception.aspx).
1.1.2.4.2.3. Con: Abstinence is always effective.
1.1.2.4.2.3.1. Con: An abstinent woman can still be raped and become pregnant.
1.1.2.4.2.3.2. Con: Abstinence is only 100% effective if used perfectly. The "typical use" effectiveness of abstinence as a contraceptive is not [100%.](https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/12/understanding-abstinence-implications-individuals-programs-and-policies)
1.1.2.4.2.3.3. Con: It is unreasonable to expect people to remain abstinent forever. There are people who may want to have sex lives but do not ever want to have children. For them there is no fail proof form of contraception.
1.1.2.4.2.3.3.1. Pro: Humans are designed to find pleasure in sexual relations. Sex is more than just for reproduction; it is also a bonding mechanism between life-long partners. Therefore an abstinence only method is an unreasonable burden for a person to bear.
1.1.2.4.2.3.3.1.1. Con: The [primary role](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zg668mn/revision/4)(One of the main purposes of sex is procreation. The Church teaches that, "The spouses' union achieves the twofold end of marriage: the good of the spouses themselves and the transmission of life. These two meanings or values of marriage cannot be separated..." \(CCC 2363\).) of sexual relations is reproduction. This is true in all species that reproduce by mating. The pleasure and bonding effect of a sexual relation is subservient to its purpose as a reproduction mechanism.
1.1.2.4.2.3.3.1.1.1. Con: People have sex for [pleasure and bonding effects](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095\(18\)30132-2/abstract) more often than for reproduction across all ages.
1.1.2.4.2.4. Con: Sterilization procedures \(hysterectomy, vasectomies\) are [almost 100% effective](https://www.healthline.com/health/birth-control-female-sterilization).
1.1.2.4.2.4.1. Con: Although it is rare, vasectomy failure is still a [possibility](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/vasectomy/conditioninfo/Pages/effective.aspx). In the first year after vasectomy, 15 to 20 of every 10,000 couples experience a pregnancy.
1.1.2.4.2.4.2. Pro: Male vasectomies are [both](https://familydoctor.org/vasectomy-what-to-expect/) reversible and do not stop your body from producing sperm. It is one of the most highly-effective birth control measures while still maintaining the possibility of having children in the future.
1.1.2.4.2.4.3. Con: There is a small risk that female sterilisation will not work - blocked tubes can rejoin any time after the [operation](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/female-sterilisation.aspx).
1.1.2.4.2.4.3.1. Pro: On average, one woman in 200 will become pregnant after undergoing a female sterilisation [procedure](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/female-sterilisation.aspx).
1.1.2.4.2.4.4. Con: Sterilisation is a near-[permanent](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/female-sterilisation.aspx) procedure - it is not a suitable contraceptive option for people who want to have children in the future.
1.1.2.4.2.5. Con: Contraceptives advertise that they are not 100% effective. Even though these devices or drugs decrease the likelihood of pregnancy they don't negate the responsibility for the risk of the action chosen.
1.1.2.4.3. Con: This argument is only works if we accept that sex and/or abortion are inherently immoral. If neither sex nor abortion is immoral, then there is no reason to punish the behavior of having sex and getting pregnant with restricted access to abortion.
1.1.2.4.4. Con: Carrying a child is an important thing for a woman. Choosing abortion [isn't an easy decision](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/05/pregnancy-vermont-paid-parental-leave-abortion-difficult-decision), and the women that find this decision easy are a minority. Generally when a woman is considering abortion, she thinks about why she can't rather than why she 'just doesn't want to'.
1.1.2.4.4.1. Pro: There should be laws requiring mandatory consultations to make this decision as informed and conscious as possible. This will go a long way towards eliminating "convenience abortions".
1.1.2.5. Pro: Legal abortion will lower the sense of responsibility. Being responsible for your own sexual actions and performing safe sex is essential and the lack thereof should not be sufficient argument for legal abortion.
1.1.3. Pro: When abortion is banned, many women who do not want a child [seek out illegal abortions](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21255186/ns/health-womens_health/t/abortion-rates-same-whether-legal-or-not/).
1.1.3.1. Pro: If abortions will happen anyway, it is preferable to make them as safe as possible so at least the women survive the procedure.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.3.
1.1.3.2. Pro: When abortion is banned, in practice this means that only women who can afford it can access safe abortion, since it is more expensive when illegal.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Getting a safe abortion when it is illegal is more expensive and in low-income countries, [a significant fraction of the population cannot afford it](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/preventing-unsafe-abortion).
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Women who are denied abortions are [three times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/magazine/study-women-denied-abortions.html) more likely to be living below the poverty line two years later than women who are able to access them.
1.1.3.3. Con: Many women will keep their baby if abortion is banned. This [study](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18338) found if abortion were prohibited in 31 states, the national US abortion rate would fall by 14.9%.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: That leaves over 550,000 women every year that will still get an abortion but in an illegal way, which is much less safe.
1.1.3.4. Con: Putting the child up for adoption is an alternative to abortion.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: Adoption is unlikely to be a feasible alternative unless the state intervenes to further promote adoption or take responsibility for unwanted children.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Many children given up for adoption are never adopted.
1.1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: There are [hundreds of thousands](https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/adoption-shortfall-england-children-waiting-350262)(There is a massive shortfall in families willing to adopt children in England, with thousands of children waiting to find a home.\n\nAccording to figures from the Adoption and Special Guardianship Leadership Board \(ASGLB\), there are 4,140 youngsters across England who have been put up for adoption by authorities.) of children waiting to be adopted. The reality is that tens of thousands of children will never be adopted, and are condemned to a childhood of foster care and youth homes.
1.1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: This statement implies that growing up in foster home is worse than being aborted which doesn't seem tenable, especially when the recipient of either option has no say in the matter.
1.1.3.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: In the United States, there are over [3x](https://adoptionnetwork.com/adoption-statistics) more children in adoption than there are getting adopted each year.
1.1.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: Adoption is not a viable option in a huge number of countries, where the social care system is not developed enough.
1.1.3.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: 20 countries do not even recognize the institution of adoption, as can be seen in this UN report, [Child Adoption: Trends and Policies](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/child-adoption.pdf) on page 26.
1.1.3.4.1.1.2.2. Con: Developing countries are [making reforms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4140377/) to their social care systems, which may have a positive impact in terms of adoption being a more viable option for people.
1.1.3.4.1.1.2.3. Pro: There are very low rates of adoption in many African countries. In Benin, Mozambique, Niger, and Tanzania there is only about one adoption for every million persons under the age of 18 \([p. 68](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwiYq-2ZvrDmAhVZURUIHdGNC_0QFjAAegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.un.org%2Fen%2Fdevelopment%2Fdesa%2Fpopulation%2Fpublications%2Fpdf%2Fpolicy%2Fchild-adoption.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1HYCzXdPRDyB2-mV7uDAgp)\).
1.1.3.4.1.1.3. Con: Babies are adopted more easily than older children. The average age of [children waiting to be adopted](https://showhope.org/2015/06/19/9-stats-about-the-orphan-crisis/) is 7.5 years.
1.1.3.4.1.1.4. Con: There are people on [waiting lists](https://www.americanadoptions.com/pregnant/waiting_adoptive_families) to be chosen for babies already and adoptive parents can be chosen before the baby is born.
1.1.3.4.1.1.5. Con: In the United States, 60% of children spend [2-5 years](https://adoptionnetwork.com/adoption-statistics) in foster care but are then adopted.
1.1.3.4.1.1.6. Pro: In the US, about [135,000](http://www.pbs.org/pov/offandrunning/fact-sheet/) children are adopted each year compared to about [650,000](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm) abortions. If abortion is not legalized, the number of adoptions would need to increase substantially to make up the difference or hundreds of thousands of additional children every year would end up in the already overburdened foster care system.
1.1.3.4.1.1.6.1. Pro: Women are likely to seek even more illegal abortions when the foster care system is imploding and can't guarantee a decent life for their children.
1.1.3.4.1.2. Con: In Brazil, [for every child available for adoption there are 6 families in the adoption queue](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil/2016/05/160509_adocao_criancas_ab) and 84% of the families are looking for children up to 5 years old. Interested families largely outnumber the children to be adopted.
1.1.3.4.2. Pro: Even if adoption isn't perfect, it is still better than abortion because the child survives.
1.1.3.4.2.1. Con: Neither fetuses nor embryos can be strictly classified as children. As such, abortion usually does not result in the death of a child.
1.1.3.4.2.2. Pro: There are many people who are unable to have children and would like the opportunity to adopt one.
1.1.3.4.2.2.1. Con: A woman with an unwanted pregnancy has no duty to fulfill the desire of another person to have and raise a child.
1.1.3.4.2.2.2. Pro: In the [US](http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/18/why-so-many-families-who-want-to-adopt-cant/), there are significantly more people who want to adopt than there are children to adopt.
1.1.3.4.2.2.3. Con: There are numerous children [waiting to be adopted](https://www.statista.com/statistics/255375/number-of-children-waiting-to-be-adopted-in-the-united-states/) in the US and throughout the world, as childless people prefer infants to toddlers or even juveniles, as well as preferring [white children to black children](https://adoptionnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Adoption-Statistics.png).
1.1.3.4.2.3. Pro: It is very likely that many adoptees and former foster children appreciate the [fact that they are alive](http://www.teenbreaks.com/abortion/abortionsurvivors.cfm).
1.1.3.4.2.3.1. Con: The [suicide](https://adoption.com/adoption-related-suicide-statistics-prevention) rate of adoptees is four times greater than the suicide rate of non-adoptees.
1.1.3.4.2.3.1.1. Con: It remains the fact that many of adoptees appreciate the fact that they are alive. 7.6 percent of adoptees trying to commit suicide, as stated in this [study](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/810625), are still a small minority.
1.1.3.4.2.3.2. Con: Appreciating that you're alive is only possible if you're alive. There's no opposite — you can't be regretful that you're not alive.
1.1.3.4.2.4. Pro: The child can go on to have a whole life through adoption, and beyond the nine months of pregnancy, does not have to be a burden for the parent who did not want or was not ready to have them.
1.1.3.4.2.5. Con: Adoption does not guarantee a safe life for children.
1.1.3.4.2.5.1. Con: Most children would probably prefer adoption to abortion if given a choice, even if adoption and foster care are not perfect.
1.1.3.4.2.5.1.1. Con: It is not possible to infer the preferences of an entity that lacks that the mental architecture to carry a preference.
1.1.3.4.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: The woman and her doctor are in the best position to make such a consequential decision.
1.1.3.4.2.5.1.1.2. Con: It is reasonable to assume that a late-stage fetus \(e.g. 8 months\) is no less capable of having a preference than a newborn.
1.1.3.4.2.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: This is likely true. A newborn baby has no capability of weighing the benefits and detriments of [life or no life](https://www.bmj.com/content/322/7300/1481.full)(If a pregnancy is terminated because the fetus has an abnormality we will never know for sure whether the life in question would have been worth living. However, we allow lives to be terminated if they are predicted to be of low \(or maybe only slightly diminished\) quality.). It's a philosophical conundrum even deep-thinking philosophers struggle with.
1.1.3.4.2.5.1.1.2.2. Con: There are [numerous physiological changes](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002395.htm) that occur at birth, including shifting the blood flow to pass through the lungs. Previous to birth, a fully conscious individual would suffer from sensory deprivation. Therefore it is probable that some physiological change occurs that ignites consciousness.
1.1.3.4.2.5.1.2. Pro: Even children who [undergo horrific abuse](https://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1081&context=utk_nurspubs) still have a strong will to survive, so it is reasonable that the vast majority of children would prefer even the worst forms of adoption to abortion.
1.1.3.4.2.5.1.2.1. Con: Some children do overcome the hardships of being unwanted and/or abused, some don't. [Suicide rates](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691619895076?journalCode=ppsa) among youths in foster care are among the highest in the United States. To claim the "vast majority" of children would prefer pain, lack of love, disconnectedness and dim future prospects over having not been born at all is supported by unfounded hope alone.
1.1.3.4.2.5.1.3. Con: Some people are now [attempting to sue their parents](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/anti-natalists-childfree-population-climate-change) for recklessly bringing them into the world, as the parents knew of defects and circumstances that handicapped them.
1.1.3.4.2.5.1.3.1. Con: These are still a small minority of people. One cannot assume their child will become one of them.
1.1.3.4.2.5.1.3.2. Pro: This [area of law](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/anti-natalists-childfree-population-climate-change) is as yet undeveloped but test cases are forming. This shows that some people don't appreciate having been allowed to be born into adverse conditions.
1.1.3.4.2.5.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.3.1.1.
1.1.3.4.2.5.2. Pro: State institutions are bad at properly assessing whether or not the environment of foster homes are safe.
1.1.3.4.2.5.2.1. Con: [Policies](http://hscchildcareprocedures.gov.gg/article/118316/Safer-Care-in-Foster-Homes) are generally in place to ensure foster homes are safe, including annual reviews.
1.1.3.4.2.5.2.2. Con: In the UK, there is legislation underpinning the work of fostering agencies, requiring them to ensure children are safeguarded and protected from significant harm \([p. 14](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjkopjshJXzAhWNecAKHWcvBjcQFnoECCIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.publishing.service.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fuploads%2Fsystem%2Fuploads%2Fattachment_data%2Ffile%2F192705%2FNMS_Fostering_Services.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3sDQfXXq9fvNi-w--c91fK)\).
1.1.3.4.2.5.2.3. Pro: Private foster care agencies have [allowed](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/evey-rosenbloom/where-do-the-children-go_1_b_8728758.html) criminals and registered sex offenders to acquire licenses and adopt foster children. This has led to neglect, sexual abuse and murders of children.
1.1.3.4.2.5.2.3.1. Pro: A caseworker in one such agency reported that three girls were happy and healthy in their foster home when in fact they had been [dead for three months](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-09-20/news/9609200157_1_state-caseworker-report-illinois-supreme-court). This is indicative of the sheer ineptitude of many foster care agencies.
1.1.3.4.2.5.2.3.2. Pro: Many LGBTQ children in foster homes suffer abuse. As a result, in the US, 56% spent some time homeless because they believed they were safer on the streets than they were in their foster homes \([p. 5](https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/LGBTQyouth.pdf)\).
1.1.3.4.2.5.2.4. Pro: The screening process is only as good as the person who makes the assessment and the level of stress or workload they may be facing.
1.1.3.4.2.5.2.4.1. Pro: In New York, the [40% turnover](http://www.gothamgazette.com/housing/1915-flaws-in-the-screening-process-for-foster-parents) in caseworkers is testament to the heavy workload they face, which could reflect in the quality of their work.
1.1.3.4.2.5.2.4.2. Pro: The average foster care social worker is paid [$47,372](https://infograph.venngage.com/p/243734/3-ways-to-improve-the-foster-care-system) annually. This is substantially less than other working professionals such as IT Managers \([$79,584](http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2015/07/09/average-salaries-for-americans-median-salaries-for-common-jobs.html)\) or HR managers \([$73,474](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/human-resources-manager-salary-SRCH_KO0,23.htm)\). These workers are then forced to make tough decisions and deal with difficult situations on a day to day basis.
1.1.3.4.2.5.2.5. Pro: According to the Child Advocate Review, the quality of safety assessments only met standards in 46% of reviewed cases \([p. 15](http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/OPI/Reports_to_the_Legislature/child_advocate_review_december2008.pdf)\).
1.1.3.4.2.5.3. Con: Birth doesn't guarantee a safe life for children. Expecting parents who want a child can't even guarantee a safe life for children. Abortion, however, guarantees that the child will not have a safe life, or a life at all.
1.1.3.4.2.5.3.1. Con: Abortion guarantees a child will not have an unsafe or miserable life. To prevent a likely painful and difficult life can be a blessing.
1.1.3.4.2.6. Con: Because the system is so overburdened, children are often placed in [abusive foster homes](http://www.upworthy.com/the-horror-stories-these-former-foster-care-kids-have-sound-too-bad-to-be-true-but-theyre-not) or replaced in the care of their abusive parents.
1.1.3.4.2.6.1. Pro: Despite the fact that $22 billion are spent on [foster care programs](http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/FosterCare/story?id=2017991&page=1) every year in the US, nearly 60,000 children are reported weekly as abused or neglected. This suggests that the state is incapable of effectively preventing child abuse within the foster care system.
1.1.3.4.2.6.1.1. Pro: [Research](http://www.liftingtheveil.org/foster04.htm) in the US determined that over 28% of foster children experienced abuse while in the foster care system, and many [former foster children](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/somatic-psychology/201201/the-foster-care-system-and-its-victims-part-2) believe that the number of incidents are much higher.
1.1.3.4.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: The rate of sexual abuse in foster homes in the UK was found to be [four times higher](http://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=6703) than the national average, and twenty eight times higher in group homes.
1.1.3.4.2.6.1.1.2. Con: Quality of life should not determine value of life.
1.1.3.4.2.6.1.1.2.1. Con: The value of a person's life to themselves is 100% determined by quality of life. Forcing a person to experience a pervasive negative quality of life is the definition of cruelty.
1.1.3.4.2.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: Many people would argue that life in itself is better than no life at all, regardless of quality.
1.1.3.4.2.6.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Others would argue that to bring a child with serious congenital malformations which cause pain and suffering to its short life is cruel and that life is not always better than no life.
1.1.3.4.2.6.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: It is impossible to determine what kind of life one will live, hence we must give the unborn a chance at life.
1.1.3.4.2.6.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: It is not impossible to determine what kind of life one will live. Reasonable predictions can be made about the future life of an unborn fetus based on the socioeconomic conditions in which the mother lives.
1.1.3.4.2.6.1.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Socioeconomic conditions alone are not enough to perfectly predict the kind of life one will live.
1.1.3.4.2.6.1.1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: A poor baby may turn out to be highly intelligent, get into a good college, and get a good job. Even if one considers this unlikely, the possibility of it happening means we should not conclude a poor baby will "definitely not have a good life."
1.1.3.4.2.6.1.1.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: Unhealthy family interrelations, i.e., a violent or dangerous history, as well as environmental conditions, such as inhospitable neighborhoods, and health conditions of the fetus can also play a part in the decision as to whether or not to bring a child into the world.
1.1.3.4.2.6.1.1.2.2.2.2. Con: Because it cannot be predicted if a child born into severely detrimental circumstances will ever overcome the adversity and go on to live a meaningful life, the most compassionate act may be to avoid any suffering from the start and opt for abortion.
1.1.3.4.2.6.1.1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.5.1.1.1.
1.1.3.4.2.6.2. Pro: The banning of abortion in Romania led to an orphan crisis, where [150,000](http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/14/news/mn-29897) unwanted infants were put in extremely poorly run state orphanages.
1.1.3.4.2.6.2.1. Pro: Even decades on, many of these orphans [suffer](https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-01-16/romanian-orphans-face-challenges-decades-after-adoption) from mental and physical health conditions as a result of the conditions they lived in.
1.1.3.4.2.7. Pro: Adoption agencies can ensure that the child is matched with a family that has similar values and beliefs to that of the biological mother.
1.1.3.4.2.7.1. Con: If the adoption agency is primarily concerned with the values of the adoptive parents \(aside from whether they will take care of the child\), the child will be less likely to be adopted because the search field is narrowed.
1.1.3.4.2.7.1.1. Pro: For example, the agency might avoid perfectly good parents solely because they happen to be two people of the same gender who are married to each other.
1.1.3.4.2.7.2. Con: This isn't an important aspect of adoption. The mother's values and beliefs might be the reason why she is unable to care for the child.
1.1.3.4.2.7.3. Pro: This may provide comfort to the biological mother who is not in a position to raise the child but wants to ensure they have a good life.
1.1.3.4.2.7.4. Con: There is no way to ensure that information can be verified, as potential parents can just lie about their values to get a child faster.
1.1.3.4.2.7.4.1. Pro: There is a great incentive for potential parents to lie about their values if they feel this is the only way they will be successful in receiving a child.
1.1.3.4.2.7.4.2. Con: The process for adopting a child can be [very long](https://adoptionnetwork.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-adopt-a-child), and it involves a [psychological assessment](http://www.annegraham.ca/international-adoption-psychological-assessment.html) that can hardly be forged.
1.1.3.4.2.7.5. Pro: There is a [shortage](http://www.americanadoptions.com/pregnant/waiting_adoptive_families) of children in need of parents in the west, meaning that agencies can choose parents from a large competitive pool.
1.1.3.4.2.7.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.2.
1.1.3.4.2.8. Con: Youth in foster care and adults who formerly were placed in care have disproportionately high [rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3061347/) of emotional and behavioural disorders.
1.1.3.4.2.8.1. Pro: The life long impacts of adoption, including [trauma](https://postinstitute.com/the-adopted-child-trauma-and-its-impact/) is well [evidenced](https://www.psychology.org.au/inpsych/2014/august/green/) and documented.
1.1.3.4.3. Con: Adoption is not a reasonable alternative given it requires women to go through pregnancy and childbirth, and bring a genetically related child into the world.
1.1.3.4.3.1. Pro: From the perspective of most pregnant women, adoption will be an unattractive option.
1.1.3.4.3.1.1. Pro: The pregnant woman may well face pain, both during and after their pregnancy, only to give up their child.
1.1.3.4.3.2. Con: While pregnancy and childbirth may be difficult, they are also temporary, and adoption provides an alternative to still give the child a life.
1.1.3.4.3.3. Pro: Adoption is not a viable alternative to abortion in cases when the pregnancy endangers the mother.
1.1.3.4.3.3.1. Con: Even if in these cases abortion has a chance of saving the woman's life, abortion is always guaranteed to kill the fetus. We should not kill one person just to try to save another.
1.1.3.4.3.3.1.1. Con: In situations where pregnancy endangers a mother, the fetus is also likely in jeopardy. There for it is not as simple as exchanging one life for another, but rather opting to save one person versus allowing two to die.
1.1.3.4.3.3.2. Pro: Not all women are equipped to bring a baby into the world. Conditions such as [HIV/AIDS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4302331/), and cardiovascular disease can complicate pregnancy and increase the risk of maternal death.
1.1.3.4.3.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.3.4.3.3.2.2. Pro: The UN Population Fund estimated that [289,000 women died](https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/05/467712-maternal-death-rates-fall-chronic-diseases-increase-pregnancy-risk-un-agency) during pregnancy in 2013.
1.1.3.4.3.3.3. Pro: If a woman is in an abusive relationship, adoption is not always a viable option to abortion as the abusive father still has paternity rights and could claim the child and use it as leverage against the mother.
1.1.3.4.3.3.3.1. Pro: If an abusive father chooses to do this, it may also lead to abuse of the child.
1.1.3.4.3.3.4. Con: Having an abortion for medical reasons makes up [less than 1%](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html) of all abortions, even lower when the "life of the mother" is in jeopardy. The utilitarian justification for abortion is therefore very, very small.
1.1.3.4.3.3.4.1. Con: Abortion would still need to be legal for those cases, as adoption would not solve the issue at hand.
1.1.3.4.3.3.4.2. Pro: It is reasonable to give priority to the mother over the child in extreme cases. However, this does not make voluntary abortions acceptable.
1.1.3.4.3.3.4.3. Con: The number of times something happens doesn't always make it less important. If you, or someone else you care about, were in that 1%, you would likely want them to be able to access to abortion.
1.1.3.4.3.3.4.4. Con: "Less than 1% of all abortions" could be misleading because if between 1970 and 2014, there were "44.5 [million legal induced abortions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_statistics_in_the_United_States)", then there could be 445k abortions that fall in this category. That would be a significant impact to a lot of people.
1.1.3.4.3.3.4.5. Pro: Statistics regarding the number of abortions due to endangerment of mother's life back this up. [Florida](https://ahca.myflorida.com/MCHQ/Central_Services/Training_Support/docs/ReasonGestation_2015.pdf), 2015: 0.065%. [UK](https://davidalton.net/2012/07/21/latest-abortion-figures-6-3-million-abortions-143-where-a-womans-life-was-in-danger/),1968-2011: 0.006%. [U.S.](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html#8) estimate: 1%.
1.1.3.4.3.3.5. Pro: Childbirth is [a risk](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/labor-delivery/topicinfo/complications) for any woman. Women that have health issues and should not give birth as it will impede their health need a viable and legal alternative.
1.1.3.4.3.4. Pro: There are numerous social implications for the mother who opts to put their child up for adoption, such as constant judgement by others around them.
1.1.3.4.3.4.1. Pro: People tend to ask expectant mothers questions which could be awkward should the mother be putting the child up for adoption, such as '[was it planned](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/was-it-planned-pregnancy-question_uk_5a4b630de4b025f99e1d5326)'.
1.1.3.4.3.4.2. Pro: A study has found women who give up their child for adoption are viewed [less favourably](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27166869/) than those who choose to raise their children.
1.1.3.4.3.4.3. Con: Women are already [judged](https://theconversation.com/how-womens-life-long-experiences-of-being-judged-by-their-appearance-affect-how-they-feel-in-open-plan-offices-124765) for their appearance. The problem is with the superficiality of society, not the lack of abortion access.
1.1.3.4.3.5. Pro: There are a large number of financial requirements of being pregnant and having a child, even if you plan to give it up for adoption. These costs may mean adoption is not a viable alternative for many women.
1.1.3.4.3.5.1. Pro: Many women cannot afford to take time off work for their pregnancy, even if they are not going to take time off to look after and raise the child.
1.1.3.4.3.5.2. Pro: Such costs include pre-natal care and hospital care during labour.
1.1.3.4.3.5.3. Con: Government services should be available to intended adoptees to support them in this. The lack of this service is not grounds for termination.
1.1.3.4.3.6. Con: Women consent to the risk of becoming pregnant whenever they choose to have sex.
1.1.3.4.3.6.1. Con: When one consents to play a contact sport one does not sign away the right to surgery to correct an injury, despite knowing that injury is possible.
1.1.3.4.3.6.1.1. Con: This is a false equivalency, as the recovery from a contact sport injury does not involve killing another human organism, so there is no possible conflict-of-rights that exists in the case of an unwanted pregnancy.
1.1.3.4.3.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.3.1.
1.1.3.4.3.6.3. Pro: It is possible for women to research nonprocreative sex acts and their associated likelihood of pregnancy. As such they are aware of the risks, and it is possible for them to consent to pregnancy.
1.1.3.4.3.6.3.1. Pro: It is possible for women to participate in sexual activities such as oral sex, which will not result in pregnancy.
1.1.3.4.3.6.3.1.1. Pro: Oral sex, which can be considered a form of contraception in the sense of sexual activity that avoids procreation, is 100% effective at not resulting in pregnancy.
1.1.3.4.3.6.3.2. Con: There are many [factors](https://fertilitynetworkuk.org/fertility-faqs/factors-affecting-fertility/) that fertility which may lead women to underestimate their likelihood of pregnancy. Though more information is available, that may not effect how they understand the [risk](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-inertia-trap/201303/why-are-people-bad-evaluating-risks).
1.1.3.4.3.6.4. Pro: It is possible for women to research contraception and the likelihood of pregnancy before they have sex, such that they are aware of the risks.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1. Con: Social norms can stop people from being able to avail of contraception.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.1. Pro: A lack of sex education in many conservative regions means that couples are often ill equipped to properly use contraceptives such as condoms.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: According to [WHO](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/4/10-083329/en/), only 43% of women of reproductive age in less developed countries use modern contraceptive methods, and a wide gap in use is seen between the highest and lowest wealth quintiles \(52% versus 35%, respectively\).
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.1.2. Con: This non-excuse is not valid in an era of history where the vast majority of people in developed nations have instant access to the whole of human knowledge at the touch of a finger through the internet.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.1.2.1. Con: People tend to not seek information when they are unaware that the information exists or is important.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.1.3. Con: The solution for ignorance is to improve sex education, not implement a policy of allowing abortion.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.2. Pro: In many developing countries traditional methods and [superstitions](http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/09/26/why-222-million-women-cant-get-the-birth-control-they-need/) are held in higher regard \(and are more widespread\) than scientific information and [healthcare](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/villages-without-doctors/).
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3. Pro: Religious women are often taught that use of contraception is [deeply immoral](https://www.dummies.com/religion/christianity/catholicism/the-catholic-church-and-contraception/).
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1. Con: Contraception is considered immoral by certain religions because it interferes with the conception of a child. Religions who are against contraception are therefore also against abortion because it interferes with the birth of a child.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: Some religious values and beliefs support the view that abortion is immoral.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Until 1827, abortions prior to ["quickening"](https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft967nb5z5&chunk.id=d0e195&brand=ucpress) \(the stage where a mother could feel the fetus moving\) were commonplace and accepted by everyone including religious clerics.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.2. Con: There is no scientific or factual evidence whatsoever of the existence of a "God", and any beliefs that are credited to him are simply moral constructs devised by humans.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Since there is no evidence of God's existence, basing policy on what God may believe is ultimately unfounded speculation.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: There has been evidence of [miracles](https://churchpop.com/2015/06/28/5-extraordinary-eucharistic-miracles-with-pictures/) that have been proven true by atheist scientists, as well as excavations done by atheist [archeologists](https://www.wnd.com/2018/03/have-sodom-and-gomorrah-been-found/) that confirm, rather than deny, that the events in the Bible are true.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.2.3. Con: Even if the moral constructs underlying religion have been devised by humans, they are still valuable since a person may base their belief system on whatever they like.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.3. Con: Various religious teachings do not share this view. [Wicca](https://www.thoughtco.com/abortion-in-paganism-and-wicca-2561713), [Judaism](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-beginning-of-life-in-judaism/) and [Unitarian Universalism](https://www.uua.org/action/statements/right-choose) have varying positions on when life begins and when abortion is acceptable.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.4. Con: No one can be forced to live according to others' religious beliefs. Any denial of access to abortion based on religion is nothing other than forcing someone's beliefs on to others.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.4.1. Con: Religious beliefs and values can often be seen as good guiding principles for how people should live their lives, regardless of whether they ascribe to the religion.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.4.2. Pro: Laws are generally based on secular values, not specific religious ones, as the latter can vary from one religion to another.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: The moral stance on abortion differs between religions, and therefore is not universally considered murder.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: In [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_abortion#Islam), a fetus is thought to become a living soul only after 120 days of gestation and so abortion is generally seen as permissible until this time.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Abortion is [not uncommon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_abortion) among Hindu and Sikh communities where there is a cultural preference for male babies over female.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.4.3. Pro: If abortions are denied to women on the basis of another’s religious beliefs on when life begins, then the woman loses her right to her own religious beliefs.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.4.4. Pro: In the United States, the [First Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt1_1_1/) states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Banning abortion on religious grounds is therefore unconstitutional and illegal in the United States.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.5. Pro: Classical [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_abortion#Hinduism) texts strongly condemn abortion.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.6. Pro: Many [Orthodox Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_abortion#Judaism) feel that abortion is wrong, except in cases where it is necessary to save the woman's life.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.6.1. Con: Historically, abortion has been [accepted in Judaism.](https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/abortion) While many orthodox Jews oppose abortion, many do not oppose it.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.7. Pro: Abortion is generally forbidden in [Sikhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_abortion#Sikhism) on the basis that it interferes with the work of God.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.8. Pro: The [Catholic Church](https://www.catholic.com/tract/abortion) has always strongly condemned abortion.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.8.1. Con: Catholics do not uniformly oppose abortion. For example, the [Catholics for choice group](http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/about-us/), believe that abortion rights and Catholicism are not incompatible.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.8.2. Con: The Catholic Church has always condemned [birth control](https://theconversation.com/how-the-catholic-church-came-to-oppose-birth-control-95694) as well. Most people, including Catholics, do not agree with this stance. Therefore, the Catholic Church's moral stance on an issue is generally accepted to fallible.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.8.3. Pro: [Pope Francis](https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2016/11/20/pope-francis-calls-abortion-horrendous-crime-grave-sin/) described abortion as a 'very grave sin' and a 'horrendous crime'.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.8.3.1. Con: Pope Francis's statements made it clear that women who have had abortions would still be considered members of the Catholic Church and that they could be forgiven by priests. This represents a [softening](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38054640) of the Catholic Church's position towards abortion. Previously, any individual who performed or had an abortion could be immediately excommunicated from the Catholic Church.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.8.3.2. Pro: His analogy compared abortion to hiring a hitman to take a life.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.9. Pro: The [Bible](https://www.ucg.org/the-good-news/the-abortion-debate-what-does-god-say) shows that God felt all human lives should be protected, including those in the womb.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.9.1. Pro: When Elizabeth's baby leaps for joy in her womb \([Luke 1:41,44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201&version=NIV)\) this implies that the baby is a person.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.9.2. Pro: In [Psalm 51:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2051&version=NIV) David says, "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me. Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb; you taught me wisdom in that secret place."
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.9.3. Con: Christians have long discarded many outmoded Bible covenants. The Bible states, "But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head..."\([1 Corinthians 11:5](http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-5.htm)\). Enforcing this in many countries would would be resisted by many of the same who are pro-life.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.9.4. Con: There are numerous examples of God-ordained infanticide, child murder, and the murder of pregnant women in the Old Testament. These include [Jeremiah 11:22-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+11%3A22-23&version=NIV), [Psalm 135:8](http://biblehub.com/psalms/135-8.htm) and [2 Kings 15:16](http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-16.htm).
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.9.4.1. Con: Menahem is shown to commit infanticide in 2 Kings 15:15, but [2 Kings 15:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%2015&version=NIV)(He did evil in the eyes of the Lord. During his entire reign he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.) illustrates the fact that God did not necessarily approve of Menahem's actions.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.9.5. Pro: In [Jeremiah 1:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/1?lang=eng) it says, "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you." This tells us that the Bible shows that the unborn are priceless, and genuinely meant to live.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.9.6. Pro: The Bible states that God believes if a man causes injury to a woman who is pregnant, and in turn kills the fetus, then he should give [life for life](https://www.ucg.org/the-good-news/the-abortion-debate-what-does-god-say). This indicates that God believes the fetus to be a living being and its killing to be wrong.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.9.6.1. Pro: The verse \([Exodus 21:22](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/exodus/21-22.htm)\) calls the baby a [yeled](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3206.htm), or 'child', thus teaching that it is a person.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.9.6.2. Con: This is inaccurate. Exodus 21:22 says that if a woman is accidentally injured in a fight and miscarries, the one who injured her [has to pay a fee to the husband](https://biblehub.com/drb/exodus/21.htm). The husband decides on the fee. If the woman dies, the normal punishment for murder is applied \(eye for an eye etc\).
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.9.6.2.1. Con: In the case where a fine is paid, the baby was not 'miscarried.' In describing what happened the [Hebrew](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/exodus/21-22.htm) words of "yeled" and "yatsa" translate to "the child went out". This plausibly refers to a premature birth rather than a miscarriage.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.9.6.2.2. Pro: Some translations use the term "mischief" to describe the woman dying. Other translations specify different punishments based on [how far along in development the fetus was.](https://biblehub.com/sep/exodus/21.htm)
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.10. Con: Religious views are non-factual and interpretive. While there should never be mandated abortions due to religious beliefs, there should never be a legal banning of abortions due to one group's interpretation of their religious doctrine.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.2. Pro: The internet has made such information widely available, even in conservative communities.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.2.1. Con: This would assume that conservative communities are open to the use of contraception and the bodily autonomy of women which is not the [case](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/conservatives-contraception-abortion_n_5b92fd41e4b0cf7b003fc28a).
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.4. Con: When women use contraception it is clear they are trying to avoid pregnancy and therefore should not be held responsible for the outcome.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.4.1. Pro: Use of contraception indicates consent to pregnancy has explicitly not been given.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.5. Con: Low-income women often lack sexual education and even if they do have this information, they sometimes lack the resources to buy contraceptives.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.1.1.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.5.2. Pro: Contraception is not cheap or widely available in many developing countries around the world, even in some parts of the [US](https://www.reproductiverights.org/project/contraceptive-access-in-the-united-states) and Europe.
1.1.3.4.3.6.4.5.2.1. Con: A small pack of condoms will cost you around 5€. Less developed countries may find contraception somewhat more expensive, however abortion procedures in those parts of the world are far more dangerous and costly, so prevention and abstinence are still the better options. To increase effectiveness and safety, one should compliment usage of contraception with proper sexual responsibility.
1.1.3.4.3.6.5. Con: The [definition](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/consent) of consent: "Permission for something to happen or agreement to do something.", it is not "Permission for something and all of its consequences to happen." as the parent says.
1.1.3.4.3.6.5.1. Pro: By this logic people are consenting to the risk of dying every time they cross the street. People aren't consenting to consequences.
1.1.3.4.3.6.5.1.1. Con: The chance of dying from merely crossing the street is so low that nobody should expect to die from doing this. However, the chance of pregnancy happening from sex is high enough that pregnancy should be expected by those consenting to the behavior.
1.1.3.4.3.6.5.1.2. Con: We do take a risk when we cross the street and the vast majority of us know it. That is why we look both ways to manage that risk.
1.1.3.4.3.6.5.2. Con: This claim would only be relevant if it weren't common knowledge that sex tends to result in pregnancy. If you consent to sex, you are accepting the risk. If you consent to skydiving, you accept the risk of possible parachute failure.
1.1.3.4.3.6.5.2.1. Con: If a parachute fails you shouldn't be forced to die. People can try a backup parachute. If that fails as well, people have still [survived](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qF_fzEI4wU) without one. Even if we accept that there is a risk, people will do what they can to make the risk not happen.
1.1.3.4.3.6.5.2.1.1. Con: The risk of a parachute failing to eject is far less likely than pregnancy after sex.
1.1.3.4.3.6.5.3. Pro: Morning after pills and abortions only exist because woman don't want to face the consequences, meaning they do not consent to becoming pregnant.
1.1.3.4.4. Pro: Technology will make early adoptions even easier, by allowing things such as embryo transfers for others to become surrogate parents.
1.1.3.4.4.1. Pro: [Embryo transfers](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/04/us/infertile-woman-has-baby-through-embryo-transfer.html?sec=health) can be performed where the embryo is transferred from one woman into another.
1.1.3.4.4.1.1. Con: Embryo transfer is [rarely](https://www.cnyfertility.com/embryo-transfer/) done from person to person. Rather, fertilization occurs in a laboratory setting, before the embryo is implanted in the woman.
1.1.3.4.4.2. Con: Although embryo transfer is now more prevalent, the costs which are [in the thousands,](https://www.bournhall.co.uk/fees-funding/fee-calculator/) are not feasible or easily accessible to most women, some even [going into bankruptcy,](https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/mind-and-body/infertility-ivf-surrogacy-costs) potentially putting them under further financial and emotional stress.
1.1.3.4.4.2.1. Con: Some countries provide state [funding](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/17/1/107/637987) for assisted reproductive technology, of which single embryo transfer is a part.
1.1.3.4.5. Con: The question here is whether women should or should not have the right to choose abortion. The fact that adoption is a viable option does not automatically negate a right to abortion.
1.1.3.4.5.1. Con: If it is true that adoption is a viable option, then abortion is not the only option. If there is another ethical option besides abortion, with the benefit of saving lives, it should be valued over abortion.
1.1.3.4.5.1.1. Con: Believing one option to be "better" is not an argument against people having multiple options.
1.1.3.4.5.2. Pro: Adoption is a choice that a woman should be able to make, but not forced into due to a lack of alternative options.
1.1.3.4.5.3. Pro: Adoption as an option is not mutually exclusive with the option of abortion. They can co-exist as the availability of one does not negate the other.
1.1.3.5. Con: Any act will still happen regardless of whether it is legal or illegal. This is not a sufficient reason to legalize an activity which is wrong.
1.1.3.5.1. Pro: It wouldn't be reasonable to argue that we shouldn't regulate guns because people would buy guns illegally and from dangerous people anyway.
1.1.3.5.1.1. Con: The argument isn't just that illegal abortions will still happen, but that illegal abortions are dangerous for women, as opposed to guns which are still dangerous when legal.
1.1.3.5.2. Con: This reason doesn't have to be sufficient alone, it is a factor weighing in favor of legal abortion.
1.1.3.5.3. Con: The point isn't that it would still happen if it were illegal, the point was that it would be more dangerous if it were illegal.
1.1.3.5.4. Pro: The government knows people will seek out illegal and potentially harmful drugs, but that is not a reason to lift the ban on them, making them easier to access.
1.1.3.5.4.1. Con: The war on drugs is an good example of why [prohibition](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/chart-says-war-drugs-isnt-working/322592/) does not work. Criminalizing behavior may not deter that behavior as long as incentives exist and may only compound the problem without addressing the underlying cause.
1.1.4. Pro: Access to reproductive rights are vital for girls and women to lead healthy lives. Poor sexual and reproductive health accounts for 1/3 of global diseases affecting women between 15 and 44 \([Planned Parenthood, p. 6](http://www.ippf.org/sites/default/files/2020_gender_equality_report_web.pdf)\).
1.1.4.1. Con: Immediately after that statistic the [source](https://www.ippf.org/sites/default/files/2020_gender_equality_report_web.pdf) states that "unsafe sex \[is\] a major risk factor for death and disability among women and girls in low- and middle-income countries." It is likely that a lot of the "poor sexual and reproductive health" counted in that statistic is actually caused by STDs rather than a lack of access to abortion.
1.1.5. Pro: Not all pregnancies are viable and the pregnant woman should be able to choose to end it.
1.1.5.1. Pro: [Abortion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion) simply means removing the embryo or fetus from the mother before it could live on its own. This includes medically ending non-viable pregnancies.
1.1.5.2. Pro: There are abortion laws that prevent all types of abortion unless the mother's life is in danger. This ban includes [preventing a mother from ending a non-viable pregnancy](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/3kjgzb/ireland-abortion-fatal-fetal-abnormality), forcing them to carry a baby they know won't survive to term.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Not all pregnancies that get aborted are unwanted. Some are done for [medical reasons or poor prognosis](https://www.verywellfamily.com/termination-of-a-desired-pregnancy-for-medical-reasons-2371777).
1.1.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.3.3.4.
1.1.5.3.3. Pro: An [ectopic pregnancy](http://pennmedicine.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=14&pid=14&gid=000216) means the embryo didn't implant in the uterus, likely implanting in the fallopian tube and requiring abortion to be removed.
1.1.5.3.4. Pro: A [blighted ovum](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/blighted-ovum) is a type of non-viable pregnancy. This is a fertilized egg that implants and doesn't become an embryo but the placenta and embryonic sac form. These can take a while to end in a natural abortion but a medical abortion can be used to remove it sooner.
1.1.5.3.4.1. Con: In a blighted ovum pregnancy, there is no living baby inside the uterus, so terminating this pregnancy would not be considered an abortion by pro-lifers.
1.1.5.3.5. Pro: [Molar pregnancies](https://www.verywellfamily.com/molar-pregnancy-causes-symptoms-and-treatment-2371405) are caused by a chromosomal abnormality. They can happen with pregnancies that are otherwise viable but can become cancerous. Not getting an abortion creates a serious health risk for the mother with a 60% chance of getting [persistent GTD \(cancer in the uterus\)](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/gestational-trophoblastic-disease/about/what-is-gtd.html).
1.1.5.3.5.1. Con: In a molar pregnancy, there is no living baby inside the uterus, so terminating this pregnancy would not be considered an abortion by pro-lifers.
1.1.5.3.6. Pro: [Cervical insufficiency \(incompetent cervix\)](https://www.verywellfamily.com/signs-that-you-might-have-incompetent-cervix-2371685) causes a premature dilation and thinning of the cervix before a pregnancy has reached full term and result in preterm delivery. [Abortion laws have prevented](https://www.thedailybeast.com/texas-forced-this-woman-to-deliver-a-stillborn-baby) ending this kind of pregnancy and forced mothers to experience their child die inside of them and to birth a stillborn.
1.1.5.4. Con: The fact that "not all pregnancies are viable" is insufficient support to justify shifting control of all pregnancies to the mother. This claim gives mothers control over unviable pregnancies, but not viable pregnancies.
1.1.6. Con: Abortion has [harmful](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12544786) mental and physical consequences for the woman involved.
1.1.6.1. Con: Legalizing abortion actually lowers [abortion rates.](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/abortion-rates-go-down-when-countries-make-it-legal-report-n858476)
1.1.6.1.1. Con: This point appears to have a logical assumption that lowering the rate of a behavior is a reason to legalize it if the behavior is undesired. This is consequentialist logic and it would be very questionable if hypothetically applied to universally outlawed behaviors such as rape, murder, theft, etc.
1.1.6.2. Con: Women seeking an abortion are generally able to get expert counselling and advice on the possible mental and physical consequences, which can help them make responsible [decisions](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/health/abortion-mental-health.html).
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: In the US, women seeking abortions are required to be counselled about possible emotional or psychological effects in 22 states, nine of which focus almost entirely on potential [negative effects](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/health/abortion-mental-health.html).
1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: There is no [medical evidence](http://time.com/4599806/abortion-doesnt-negatively-affect-womens-mental-health-study/) to justify laws requiring women seeking abortions to be warned about negative mental and emotional side effects.
1.1.6.3. Con: Medical help is available for women who experience mental or physical problems after having an abortion.
1.1.6.3.1. Pro: In Ireland, where abortion is legal, [counselling](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/abortion/after-an-abortion/emotional-side-effects.html) is encouraged and made accessible to those who have had an abortion.
1.1.6.3.2. Con: There is medical help is available for many conditions, such as gunshot victims and people who are in car accidents when not wearing seat belts, but that doesn't justify removing the safeguards against those conditions.
1.1.6.3.2.1. Con: If potential mental or physical harm as a result of the medical procedure is sufficient to prohibit individuals from seeking that particular procedure, then every medical procedure would need to be prohibited.
1.1.6.3.3. Con: Medical assistance will not necessarily be accessible and affordable for suffering women of [low socio-economic status](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314918/)(Evidence supports a relationship between SES \[socio-economic status\] and healthcare access as well as healthcare access and health outcomes for older adults. Because financial resources are proportional to health status, efforts are needed to support older adults and the burdened healthcare system with financial resources.).
1.1.6.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.1.6.3.5. Con: [Medical and psychiatric help](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/mental-health-in-pregnancy)(Any woman may need to take medication for many different physical and mental health problems before, during and after pregnancy. Decisions about whether to continue, change or stop medications in pregnancy are not straightforward or easy. Some medications have been used in pregnancy for many years.) is also available to women during their pregnancies who feel reluctant to birth a child due to prenatal depression or other issues surrounding it.
1.1.6.4. Con: There are mental and physical consequences to every action. This is not a valid reason to restrict individual freedom.
1.1.6.4.1. Con: The debate of abortion is not simply about one individual's freedom; there are two people involved.
1.1.6.4.1.1. Con: There is no consensus on whether the fetus is a person with rights.
1.1.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: There are [disagreements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5499222/pdf/ylnq-84-130.pdf) about when personhood begins, with some arguing a fetus gains personhood at the point of fertilization and others suggesting various capacities, such as intelligence, are required.
1.1.6.4.1.1.2. Con: If there is no reasonable social consensus about whether the fetus is a person with protected rights, then we should err on the side of caution and protect the fetus.
1.1.6.4.1.1.2.1. Con: If no such consensus exists, the decision should be given to individuals, as their opinions should be taken as primarily important.
1.1.6.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: There is certainly no consensus that the fetus is some special class of human that doesn't deserve human rights. A lack of consensus should reflect a lack of action, and people who seek abortions are the first-actors of the situation.
1.1.6.4.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Denying a woman her right to decide her future, decide her family's future and dominance over her own body is not lack of action. Indeed, it's a heinous kind of action. It is active abrogation of individual rights.
1.1.6.4.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Whether or not to have a family or to add to a family is a personal decision. For any entity to intervene in this family matter is unwanted and intrusive action without standing. It would be, indeed, a consequential action.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3. Pro: Roe v Wade determined that, in the US, a fetus is [not legally recognised](https://rewire.news/article/2013/01/03/fetal-personhood-laws-juridical-persons-are-not-natural-persons-and-why-it-matter/) as a person.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.1. Con: A number of scientific advancements mean that the Roe v Wade decision should be reconsidered.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Since Roe v Wade, significant advancements have been made in [genomics](https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/timeline-history-of-genomics) allowing us to see that babies in the womb are genetically humans, beginning at [conception](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-genes-human-embryo-development-20150903-story.html).
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: The right to life is fundamental, but life begins at independent viability.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Viability is a weak argument for determining the right to life. A human on life-support isn't viable, but we still believe they are are human beings with rights.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Newborns \(and most people who are under 18\) cannot live independently, but they are still persons.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.1.2. Con: This obscures the order in which personhood is first attained. A human on life-support attains viability before losing it in this example.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: A fetus's right to life does not imply the right to use the mother's body to sustain its life.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: The mother's body naturally [sends nutrients to the fetus](https://www.google.com/search?q=mothers+body+sending+nutrients+to+baby+pregnancy&client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvKeQ4eSBcAvGG-i_0Z2TeFLToszww%3A1631884466093&ei=spREYbmTBZ6ChbIPke214AI&oq=mothers+body+sending+nutrients+to+baby+pregnancy&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBwghEAoQoAE6BwgAEEcQsAM6BAghEBVKBAhBGABQ1IIBWLaNAWCUjwFoAXACeACAAZ4BiAGkCZIBAzAuOZgBAKABAcgBCMABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwi5tKmvi4bzAhUeQUEAHZF2DSwQ4dUDCA0&uact=5)(Blood from the mother passes through the placenta, filtering oxygen, glucose and other nutrients to your baby via the umbilical cord. The placenta also filters out substances that could be harmful to your baby and removes carbon dioxide and waste products from your baby’s blood.). That she might not consciously approve of this doesn't mean the fetus is violating her rights by accepting the nutrients offered.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.2. Pro: When a fetus is able to exist independently from the mother's body they can be considered to be independent living beings. During pregnancy the fetus is [specifically reliant](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/preg-health.html)(By eating a healthy, balanced diet you're more likely to get the nutrients you need. But you will need more of the essential nutrients \(especially calcium, iron, and folic acid\) than you did before you became pregnant. Your health care provider will prescribe prenatal vitamins to be sure both you and your growing baby are getting enough.) on the mother to maintain their life, which is no longer the case once they are born, making them more independent.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.3. Pro: In Judith Jarvis Thomson's famous [violinist example](http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/Phil160,Fall02/thomson.htm), she argues that people would be outraged if upon waking up they found themselves plugged to an ailing violinist and told that in order for the violinist to remain alive, they must remain plugged to them for the next nine months.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.3.1. Con: In the violinist example the violinist is a complete stranger, while in a pregnancy the baby is the mother's own child.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: A mother who fails to provide for her own child's basic needs such as food and water is guilty of [child neglect](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/abuse/child-abuse-and-neglect.htm), whereas someone who passes a stranger on the street begging for food and doesn't give them anything is not guilty of a crime. This intuitively supports the idea that a person's obligations towards their own child is greater than that towards a stranger.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.3.1.2. Con: One plausibly has duties \(moral or legal\) to persons under one's charge, like children. However, it is not at all clear that one has duties to an unwanted fetus.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.3.1.2.1. Con: A mother [has duties](http://lawyers.com/legal-info/family-law/children/the-legal-rights-and-responsibilities-of-a-parent.html) to her two-year-old son, regardless of whether the child is "wanted". Therefore it is plausible that the fetus being "unwanted" doesn't take away her duties towards it.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.3.2. Con: The violinist example can only be used to justify abortion in the case of rape, because in the example, you did nothing that could have led to you being attached to the violinist.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.3.3. Pro: Such an experiment demonstrates how abortion does not violate a fetus' right to life. Rather, it just deprives the fetus of [the use](https://reasonandmeaning.com/2015/05/25/summary-of-a-defense-of-abortion-judith-jarvis-thomson/)(Now suppose that the right to life means I have the right not to be killed. Even so, my right to life doesn’t give me the right to use your body unless you give me permission. Even if your life isn’t threatened by my using your kidneys for 9 months, you don’t have to give me permission to use your kidney—even if you know that your refusal will result in my death.) of the pregnant person's body.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.3.4. Con: The violinist example is not analogous because withdrawing support is very different from directly killing. In that example, the person did not create the violinist's dependency on their body whereas the parents are responsible for the creation of a fetus, thereby creating an obligation to provide due care.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.3.4.1. Con: It is an assumption that all biological parents choose to create life, which confers obligations. Many pregnancies are accidental, and even if they weren't, you should be allowed to change your mind after experiencing the realities of pregnancy.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.3.4.2. Con: This assumes that withdrawing support is different from direct killing. This distinction is unclear at best, since both cases involve a decision \(terminate life\) causally connected to a consequence \(termination of life\).
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.3. Con: Independent viability is a moveable target, so irrelevant to the ethics of life and value. No one is 'viable' in an environment contrary to the needs of survival, such as a child in the ocean or an adult in the vacuum of space.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Future technology may be able to develop an [artificial womb](https://jme.bmj.com/content/44/11/751) or incubation method as an alternative to pregnancy. This means what is "viable" is partially dependent upon current technology and doesn't ultimately answer the question.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.3. Con: The law does not necessarily always reflect what should be the case. Morally, one can still argue that a fetus should be recognised as a person.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.3.1. Con: Morals are a set of rules that individuals live by, thus it cannot be suggested that people with different morals are somehow incorrect or wrong. Women should have the right to choose what happens to their body and to live by the morals they choose for themselves.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: If a society polices for murder, theft, or other crimes considered immoral, then that society finds it ethically acceptable to determine what is a crime, create laws to prohibit that crime, and then police to enforce the law.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: These laws may change over time as the society reevaluates and changes, but the fundamental ethics of the society hold that it may create laws based in moral principles and then enforce them.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: Saying that “women should always have the right to choose” is a moral judgment, that according to your argument, can not be judged as “correct” or “right.” All laws are codifications of moral judgments, and there are some acts that are universally considered immoral, such as the taking of an innocent human life.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: In 1857, the U.S. Supreme Court declared in [Dred Scott v. Sandford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford) that blacks were 'not persons' and therefore didn't have the rights of people.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.3.3. Pro: If laws were always moral, there wouldn't be any reason to ask for a change in the law.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.4. Pro: Numerous attempts have been made to pass [personhood laws](https://rewire.news/legislative-tracker/law-topic/personhood/) in the US, which would classify zygotes, embryos and fetuses as persons, but such attempts have had little success.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.4.1. Con: That they have had little success doesn't mean that they are wrong.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.4.2. Pro: This continuity begins with sperm and egg, which would make masturbation similar to abortion.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.4.2.1. Con: Masturbation generally does not include both eggs and sperms present simultaneously, and by most definitions does not include fertilization. There is a distinct beginning of continuity with fertilization.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: There is a big jump between sperm cells and a baby with formed organs inside a mothers womb not yet able to live on its own.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.4.2.2. Con: There is no scientific basis to give personhood to the gametes of any of the two sexes. Neither of them is a [totipotent](https://www.technologynetworks.com/cell-science/articles/what-are-totipotent-stem-cells-319771) cell, with the potentiality to become human beings on their own.
1.1.6.4.1.1.3.4.2.2.1. Con: A sperm plus an egg would give rise to such a totipotent cell. If such a cell is of moral value, it stands to reason that what gives rise to it is also of moral value. In that case, destroying or preventing the development of a sperm plus egg would be as immoral as destroying or preventing the development of a zygote or fetus.
1.1.6.4.1.2. Con: A woman might feel that her home does not provide a safe environment for a child.
1.1.6.4.1.2.1. Pro: Many entire [neighborhoods](https://datacenter.kidscount.org/updates/show/199-unsafe-communities-a-reality-for-millions-of-us-kids) are not safe for raising a child.
1.1.6.4.1.2.2. Pro: Women in physically violent and abusive relationships are likely to stay [tethered](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1363/47e2315/pdf) to abusive partners when they are unable to terminate unwanted pregnancies. This puts both the women and their children at increased risk of violence.
1.1.6.4.1.2.2.1. Con: The trend described in the [source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1363/47e2315) also appears to hold for positive, healthy relationships. The benefits caused by healthy relationships lasting longer help outweigh any negative effects from bad relationships going longer than they should.
1.1.6.4.1.2.2.2. Pro: Intimate partner violence is [common](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-014-0144-z) among women having abortions, with between 6% and 22% reporting recent violence from an intimate partner. Concern about violence is a reason some pregnant women decide to terminate their pregnancies as they do not wish to expose children to violence.
1.1.6.4.1.2.2.3. Con: Governments have processes to remove children from these types of situations. This service alongside adoption, imprisonment, and help from family members saves countless children from harm.
1.1.6.4.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: For example, in the United States, there are the [Child Protective Services](https://www.childwelfare.gov/contact/).
1.1.6.4.1.2.2.3.2. Con: Child protective services takes children away from parents, which does not help the women seeking a safe environment and the intervention of the Child Protection Service may make that environment even worse.
1.1.6.4.1.2.2.3.3. Con: It would be in the state's interest to have as few children taken away from their parents by Child Protective Services as possible. Denying these abortions would mean significant increases in public spending for various social care services.
1.1.6.4.1.2.2.3.3.1. Pro: In the long term, this would cause more trouble than allowing a woman to have an abortion when she wants one.
1.1.6.4.1.2.2.3.3.2. Pro: Abortion and birth control are fiscally responsible. Spending $235 million on family planning [would save $1.32 billion](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/the-fiscal-conservatives-case-for-spending-more-money-on-birth-control/254442/).
1.1.6.4.1.2.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: Women who are denied abortions and instead give birth are 3.77 times more likely to be in poverty and 6.26 times more likely to be on public assistance 6 months after denial than women who received abortions. They are also more likely to be in poverty and remain on public assistance for 4 years after denial of abortion \([pp. 411-412](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2017.304247)\).
1.1.6.4.1.2.2.3.3.2.2. Con: This source speaks only of birth control and spending money on contraceptive services being fiscally responsible, not abortion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.2.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.2.5.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3. Con: Optimal conditions for child-rearing are relatively rare. Children raised in unsafe environments can survive and thrive despite risk factors.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1. Con: Indeed, children can survive in threatening and abusive environments where their future prospects in life are dim. However, it would be irresponsible to put children through such life trauma when we can spare them of it.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: It's neglectful, indeed possibly mean-spirited, to bring an unloved child into the world only to suffer a difficult, challenging and, likely, painful life when a mother could be sympathetic to a would-be child's future brutal life and prevent it.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Life begins at conception. Abortion therefore violates the rights to life and bodily autonomy of the fetus.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Life begins before conception. Sperm and ova are both alive. Romanticising the next step is illogical, as an embryo has little more potential to become someone than its separate parts had to become that same someone.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: A sperm or ovum in its natural environment by itself will never become an adult human being; a zygote in its natural environment \(a womb\) can.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: A zygote lacks a mind or perception. It does not matter if it is destroyed as long as it's with the consent of the mother. The potential to be a person is not equivalent to personhood.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The [spermatozoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatozoon) and the [oocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte) \(which fuse at conception to produce the zygote\) are both alive. Thus life does not begin at conception.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Sperm and ova don't contain a full human's DNA separately. They need to be combined for a life to occur and for it to start growing into a human.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Human cloning is [inevitable](https://explorebiotech.com/the-science-of-cloning-human-cloning-is-inevitable/). At that point perhaps one source of DNA may suffice.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Even though a fetus cannot necessarily exist outside a mother's body immediately, it is a living being with the potential to live a full life and therefore should be protected.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The potential to have a full life does not guarantee that the life should be protected.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: A person dying of kidney failure still has the potential for full life, but that does not grant them the right to risk the life of someone else by demanding a kidney transplant. In the same way, a fetus with the potential for full life cannot demand the use of the mother's body because pregnancy risks the mother's life.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: The number of pregnancies that are life-threatening to the mother is [extremely small](https://www.abortionfacts.com/facts/8).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Allowing abortions means allowing people to end potential lives, removing all future possibilities of this being existing and having their own desires and wants.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Abortion takes away any future experiences from a baby that was meant to be born.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The idea that someone is 'meant to do something' or that something is 'meant to happen' is an appeal to an unsubstantiated authority, and thus in effect is really just an attempt to impose the will of one person onto another.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: The suggestion that a baby was "meant to be born" relies on a belief in a higher power which has specific intentions. It is not clear that this is the case.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: It's philosophically untenable for a third party to make an argument for just one of another person's potential futures, against that person's own interest. Almost anything could conceivably prevent almost anything else in the future; it's called the [butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3. Con: Abortions have the same ethical ramifications as abstinence and contraception - all three result in the lack of a life that could have existed. If abortion is unethical, so is avoiding impregnating and avoiding being impregnated at any time.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: If we draw the line at conception, then all [hormone-based contraceptive methods](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics) are abortions.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.1.1. Con: One could reject abortion and accept hormonal contraception if they regard the intention of the woman as morally relevant.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: In the case of hormonal contraception, if a zygote does fail to implant this was not intended by the woman. Instead, she intended to prevent the meeting of sperm and egg to form the zygote in the first place. In abortion, however, the destruction of the baby is fully intended.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.1.2. Con: One could plausibly hold that abortion and hormone-based contraceptions are both immoral, so this claim doesn't address the pro-life position completely.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.1.3. Pro: [Hormone-based contraceptive methods](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-161423/falmina-28-oral/details) can thicken the lining of the uterus, preventing attachment of the fertilized egg.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.1.4. Con: Not all hormonal contraceptives are abortive. [Many prevent ovulation](https://www.verywellhealth.com/does-birth-control-stop-ovulation-906740), which means an egg is never released to be fertilized.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.1.5. Pro: If life truly were to begin at conception, IVF would also be highly immoral as [multiple eggs](https://www.healthline.com/health/in-vitro-fertilization-ivf#purpose) are fertilized in vitro, and often not all of them used.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.1.5.1. Con: Some pro-lifers such as Catholics oppose both [abortion](https://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/abortion/respect-for-unborn-human-life) and [IVF](https://www.catholicscomehome.org/what-does-the-church-teach-about-ivf/), so it is unlikely that they can be convinced to abandon the pro-life position.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.1.5.2. Pro: IVF could be considered even more immoral, since whole teams of people spend lots of time effort and money deliberately pursuing treatments that end up leaving multiple [embryos](https://whyy.org/segments/after-ivf-what-happens-to-remaining-embryos/) to die in the freezer.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.2. Con: This is a [fallacy of equivocation](https://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Equivocation.html). In the event of an abortion, the life of the fetus has already begun, so there exists something to be destroyed.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.3. Con: Neither abortion advocates nor pro-life advocates claim that there is an ethical mandate to bring all theoretically possible life into the world, so this interpretation of the ethical ramifications is an example of an [appeal to extremes](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/30/Appeal-to-Extremes) fallacy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.4. Con: Given that abstinence and contraception are merely inaction resulting in a lack of life, whereas abortion is an intentional action which leads the destruction of life, the latter is moral by comparison.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.4.1. Con: The action/inaction distinction is a matter of ease - it is hard to sacrifice your hard-earned money even when you know it's the right thing to do, but easy not to go out and rob a charity. An abortion and a healthy pregnancy both require effort and active intent.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.4.2. Con: Contraception is not inaction, as it requires very specific actions to be taken.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Some conceptions fail because the fertilised egg never implants in the uterus. Human reproduction is just too inefficient to consider conception the beginning of even a potential life.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: Every living human's life ultimately began at conception. It makes no moral difference that some were ended sooner than others.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Conception, if scientifically defined as when a sperm and egg merge, takes place at any time from moments after male ejaculation until days later. Therefore, the concept that life begins at conception is nebulous at best and has little practical value for determining the beginning of a life.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.4. Con: Vague potential cannot be the foundation of ethically significant decisions. A fetus also has the potential to live a short life filled with suffering, but we do not therefore suggest that all fetuses should be aborted.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.4.1. Con: This is a far less common outcome for babies in modern society than a long life, so it should not be assumed that any particular baby will have to undergo this.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.5. Con: Until a gestation in progress is entirely outsourceable, like parenting is, it is not ethical to force involuntary servitude \(ex: forced gestation\) on a person because they are pregnant.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.6. Pro: Even if the fetus is not "human" in the sense that it looks, walks, and talks like us, the fetus has potentiality. Left untouched, it will develop naturally into a person.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.6.1. Con: There is no guarantee that a fetus 'left untouched' would develop into a baby. Regrettably, miscarriages may occur.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Miscarriages are remarkably common and as many as 1 in 4 pregnancies end in [miscarriage](https://www.tommys.org/our-organisation/charity-research/pregnancy-statistics/miscarriage).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.6.1.1.1. Con: There is a significant difference between a miscarriage and an abortion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.6.1.2. Con: It is also true, unfortunately, that not all infants develop into adults. However, this does not justify labeling infants as nonpersons.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.6.1.3. Con: Miscarriages are not caused by people in most cases. Abortion is done on purpose.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.6.2. Con: Leaving the fetus in the womb is not the same as leaving it "untouched". At multiple stages the fetus requires assistance from the mother's body or it will cease to develop and quickly die.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.3. Con: The bodily autonomy of the fetus cannot be exercised because the will of the fetus cannot be known. That is, the fetus did not choose to be conceived. In that sense, the will of the fetus is just as likely to be violated in allowing its birth as in preventing it.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.3.1. Con: It is not true that "the will of the fetus is just as likely to be violated in allowing its birth as in preventing it" because statistically, most people who are born do not wish to be killed.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Only](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2259024/) 9.2% of people ever experience suicidal ideation. This would probably be even lower if their option for death was one of the grisly methods involved in modern abortions.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4. Pro: The right to life should be considered fundamental and absolute.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: The right to life is fundamental because it is crucial in order to allow people to access their other rights and make any future choices.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.2. Con: Governments do not do everything they can to ensure that people remain alive for as long as possible, which they should if the right to life is absolute and fundamental.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: The government made murder illegal because it violates the right to life. The same should go for abortion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Governments do not put all of their money into healthcare and medical research to allow people to live as long as possible.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.2.3. Pro: Governments do not make it a requirement of people to donate organs even though this would mean being able to save many people's lives.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.2.4. Con: Governments do not do many other things that are good for the population. What governments do or fail to do shouldn't be used as an argument for the morality of anything.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.2.5. Con: The 'right to life' is not the same as 'the right to be kept alive for as long as possible'. It only means that a human has the right to live, and should not be killed by another human being.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.3. Con: Capital punishment is still [legal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_country) in a number of countries, and in a number of US states. This shows that at times the state condones the ending of life, meaning the right is not absolute.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.3.1. Con: The removal of rights after due process is never the case with abortion. The gestating human has either done nothing to warrant the removal of their rights, or does not even possess such rights. Capital punishment has no bearing on the abortion discussion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Capital punishment is a penalty meant for someone who committed serious crimes. The fetus' life should not be terminated since he/she did not commit any crime.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.3.2. Con: Capital punishment is a specific circumstance where people have committed a heinous crime and therefore have a number of their rights restricted or taken away.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.3.3. Con: Capital punishment is an act of self-defense, imparted only by the State, and is an act of last resort, i.e. the prisoner is still a danger to society. It is not a statement on the value or right to life of the one being executed.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Capital punishment protects the right to life by establishing consequences for murderers.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.4. Pro: The right to life is enshrined in [Article 3](http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/udhr_article_3.html) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.4.1. Con: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not a [legally binding](https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/srhrdefenders/pages/declaration.aspx) instrument.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.4.1.1. Con: The legal ramifications of a document have no bearing on the moral applicability of its implications.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.4.4.2. Con: The fact that the right to life is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \(UDHR\) doesn't make the right to life absolute. The UDHR says nothing about the right to life of animals or \(hypothetical\) aliens. The first article makes it clear that such rights [begin at birth \(p. 120\).](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/S0968-8080%2805%2926218-3)
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6. Pro: Biological facts indicate that fetuses are human.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.1. Pro: Human embryos autonomously [direct their own development](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb3347) after conception, even when they are not in their mothers’ wombs.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.1.1. Con: This is not enough to define embryos as complete humans worthy of every human right.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.2. Con: Skin cells are as human as a zygote, gall bladders are as human as a fetus. In neither case is it immoral to destroy the former, thus simply being human is an insufficient criterion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: A fetus is human in that it has human DNA: [skin cells and gall bladders have human DN](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/dna)(Nearly every cell in a person’s body has the same DNA.)A.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.2.2. Pro: Skin cells and gall bladders could develop into a full human \(via [cloning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning) or transformation into [induced pluripotent stem cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell)\), just as a fetus could.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.2.3. Con: A gall bladder is part of a human, and so are skin cells. However, a zygote is a whole human, which makes it immoral to destroy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.2.3.1. Con: Fetuses are not whole humans. If they were, they would be able to live outside the womb without the mother's help. The earlier in the development of a fetus, the less whole it is.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.1.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.2.4. Con: It is, in fact, immoral to destroy someone else's gall bladder without their permission.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.3. Con: There is plenty of evidence that a human fetus is of human origin. Lacking is the evidence that it's a person.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: In US federal law, the concept of legal personhood is formalized by statute \([1 USC §8](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/8)\) to include "every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development."
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.1.3.3.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.1.3.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.4. Pro: After [4-6 weeks](https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/fetal-development/fetal-heart-heartbeat-circulatory-system/) of fetal development, the fetus develops a heartbeat. A heartbeat is an indication of life so the fetus should get legal protections as a human with the right to life.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.4.1. Con: A heartbeat is not enough to define life. The neural system is far more relevant to draw a line between an alive and conscious human and a bunch of worthless cells.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.4.1.1. Con: Given scientists and philosophers haven't reached a consensus on the difference between a human and a fetus in terms of the brain, using the brain as the sole criteria is an unnecessary ethical risk.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.4.1.2. Con: While a fetus doesn't have brain and heart activity, all its cells are working together for the survival of the system as a whole. [This is an important component of cellular organization, a central benchmark of biological life.](https://www2.estrellamountain.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/BioBookCELL2.html)
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.4.2. Pro: If we claim a person to be dead when their heart stops beating, life should begin when their heart starts beating. Claiming the fetus is not independently survivable at that point doesn't matter. Many people are kept alive by the assistance of machinery and technology.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.4.2.1. Con: CPR happens when a heart stops beating and doesn't stop without reason, until then only a doctor can pronounce someone dead. This is because even people with experience and knowledge can't call someone else dead because their heart stops beating.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.4.2.2. Con: A beginning and end are different. A person dying when their heart stops doesn't mean the heart beating is when it starts.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.4.2.3. Con: This would imply that a heart beating was a necessary condition for human personhood, not that it was a sufficient condition.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.4.3. Con: Though what seems like a heartbeat happens after twenty days, the heart isn't developed until [twenty](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=167987) weeks.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.4.4. Con: We do not consider it [murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder#Definition) to "pull the plug" on someone who is brain dead, even if their heart is beating.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.4.4.1. Pro: A heartbeat is a mechanical function like any other. Machines can be designed with systems which are analogous to heartbeats. The heartbeat is "an indication of life" insofar as a person without a heartbeat is generally either dead or likely to die imminently, not such that an object having a "heartbeat" makes it a living being.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.4.4.2. Con: Pulling the plug on a brain dead person occurs when medical professionals agree there is very little to no chance at life. This is not always the case for "voluntarily" aborted fetuses.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.4.4.3. Con: Some people do in fact always consider it wrong to end the life of someone who is in a coma.  As long as the patient isn't brain dead \(i.e. "dead"\) then it's wrong to pull the plug.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5. Pro: Biology textbooks are consistent that the lifecycle of a genetically distinct human organism begins at conception.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.1. Con: Tonsils and tumors are genetically human, yet it is not immoral to excise and destroy them. Thus, being genetically human is not sufficient.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.1.1. Con: Tonsils and tumors are not an entire human organism, just a part. The argument is that it is immoral to destroy an entire human organism, which a baby is.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.1.2. Pro: Having different DNA does not mean it is a separate and valid life by any means. Bacteria and some cancers have different DNA and we commonly remove it when it is growing unwanted in the human body.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.2. Pro: Biology does not treat mother and fetus as one organism, but two [separate and distinct human organisms](https://www.kialo.com/should-women-have-the-right-to-choose-abortion-5637/5637.0=5637.1-5637.2+5637.371).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.2.1. Con: A fertilized egg becomes a fetus which is physically connected to the mother's body via the umbilical cord; it is dependent on her body for nutrients, and cannot sustain its own life, therefore it is not yet separate from her body but an extension of it.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.2.2. Pro: While present in the mother's body, the fertilized egg is not part of the body and never becomes part of the mother's body. It travels through the fallopian tube entirely independent of the mother's nutrients until it attaches via placenta into the womb.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.2.3. Pro: The unborn human has its [DNA set from conception](https://www.babycenter.com/2_inside-pregnancy-your-babys-dna_10354440.bc). While similar to the mother's and father's due to inherited chromosomes and genetic traits, the DNA is not the same as the mother's.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.2.3.1. Con: Suppose the fetus was not genetically unique from its mother \(something which [is possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis#Humans)\), that would have no bearing on the question as to whether abortion was moral or not. Thus, genetic uniqueness is an irrelevant criterion when deciding the morality of abortion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.2.3.2. Con: DNA is not set but [changes over time](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-is-constantly-changing-through-the-process-6524898/).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.3. Con: The majority of biology textbooks [used to use creationism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4448468) to describe the world's history and omitted evolution. The fact that biology textbooks are consistent in how they describe conception is not a reason we should believe in that description.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.3.1. Con: Just because biology textbooks got something wrong in the past doesn't mean that their views on embryology are wrong now.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.3.1.1. Pro: When a biology textbook says that DNA has a [double helix structure](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/introchem/chapter/the-dna-double-helix/), it would make little sense to doubt that just because other textbooks used to teach creationism.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.4. Pro: The human life cycle [begins at fertilization](http://www.biologyreference.com/La-Ma/Life-Cycle-Human.html), when an egg cell inside a woman and a sperm cell from a man fuse to form a one-celled zygote.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.4.1. Con: Before fertilization, the exact same components are present as an egg and sperm. If destroying a zygote is immoral, likewise the destruction of the egg and/or the sperm that would produce it would be immoral. But the destruction of the egg or sperm is not immoral, and so destroying a zygote wouldn't be immoral.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.5. Con: Tadpoles are the beginning of the frog lifecycle. They are still not frogs any more than caterpillars are butterflies or blastocysts are human.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.5.1. Con: Actually [frogspawn](http://www.kidzone.ws/lw/frogs/facts3.htm) is the beginning of the frog lifecycle. And by this kind of thinking, you could argue that a child shouldn't be considered human because it hasn't grown into an adult yet.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.5.1.1. Pro: A living human organism [develops through stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_\(biology\)), but is not biologically less or more a human organism at any stage. Some of the various stages are zygote, blastula, embryo, fetus, neonate, infant, adolescent, and adult.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.5.2. Con: They would still have the same DNA as a frog, which makes them a frog.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.5.3. Con: The science of embryology directly falsifies this claim. Natural, developmental changes in the outward appearance of a living organism - even dramatic changes like with the butterfly - do not produce a different kind of organism. [According to modern embryology](http://naapc.org/why-life-begins-at-conception/), a zygote is a distinct, living, and whole human being.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6. Con: Being a biological human being is legally and morally distinct from being a person with the rights and responsibilities ascribed to legal [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.1. Con: This is a matter of public vote, not moral or scientific fact. So it’s somewhat cyclical to offer this as a pro-choice argument. The point at which we deem something alive is probably the most important point in the discussion of whether that thing should receive rights.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.1.1. Con: The biological definition of "life" serves a scientific purpose, and does not bestow any philosophical value on an object unless people decide that it does. Even if the deciding factor is deeming the fetus "alive", it will be a separate debate from what biologists consider useful to label as "alive".
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.1.2. Con: The public should not arbitrarily decide via a vote what is, and is not a life. They are often not qualified to do so. Scientists are qualified to do so, their expertise should not be dismissed in order to appease uninformed citizens.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2. Pro: Even if a fetus is considered human, it does not have a 'right to life' as it does not qualify for the status of '[personhood](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/a-moral-case-for-abortion/18826#.Whn73Upl86w).'
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.1. Pro: A human being requires a functional brain, wherein the mind resides. During pregnancy the brain doesn't even start to form until six weeks after conception when the [neural tube closes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302), and the brain does not become functional until ["around the time a full-term baby is born"](https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/fetal-development/fetal-brain-nervous-system/).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.1.1. Con: Being a human being does not require a functional brain because [anencephalic infants](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/anencephaly.html#:~:text=Anencephaly%20is%20a%20serious%20birth,part%20of%20the%20neural%20tube\).) do not have a functional brain, but they are still human beings.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.1.2. Pro: This is why [brain death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_death) is generally the medical definition of death.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.2. Pro: Fetuses are yet to become citizens of the state since they are unborn and therefore have no rights or protection under common law.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.2.1. Con: Citizenship is irrelevant to the legality and morality of the act. Non-citizens enjoy the protection of the law just as much as citizens do. It is not legal to kill a non-citizen any more than it is to kill a citizen \([p. 5](https://www.ohchr.org/documents/publications/noncitizensen.pdf)(All persons should, by virtue of their essential humanity, enjoy all human rights. Exceptional distinctions, for example between citizens and non-citizens, can be made only if they serve a legitimate State objective and are proportional to the achievement of that objective.)\).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.3. Con: There is no generally accepted definition of '[personhood](https://www.alzheimer-europe.org/Ethics/Definitions-and-approaches/Other-ethical-principles/Personhood)', but this argument hinges on one particular definition.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.3.1. Con: All arguments for or against abortion are dependent upon a specific definition of personhood. At its roots, it is personhood itself that is being debated. Thus it is not valid to dispute one argument but not another on this basis.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.3.2. Con: The definitions of "personhood" in which the fetus is a person in a philosophically meaningful sense are philosophically inferior to those in which a fetus is not a person.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.3.2.1. Pro: If a fetus is defined as a person, it may follow that other biological entities are persons, including bacteria, plants or some animals. As those don't meet the intuitive or conventional notion of persons, such a definition is inferior to one that meets the intuitive notion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.1.3.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.5. Con: While fetuses may not be considered people, the law has still given them rights in certain situations.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.5.1. Con: Laws can and do change and thus cannot stand as evidence for or against what should be the case.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.5.2. Pro: Some states in the US have held women [criminally liable](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fetal+Rights) for using illegal drugs that harm the fetus, therefore recognising that the fetus does have some right to not be harmed.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.5.3. Pro: [Fetal protection policies](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fetal+Rights) were used to bar women from working in roles that could cause harm to embryos or fetuses.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.5.3.1. Con: The [US Supreme Court](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fetal+Rights) determined that such policies were a form of sexual discrimination which violated the Civil Rights Act.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.5.4. Pro: The [Unborn Victims of Violence Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unborn_Victims_of_Violence_Act) recognises fetuses as legal victims if they are injured or killed as the result of a federal crime of violence.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6. Pro: A [fetus](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/a-moral-case-for-abortion/18826) is not self aware, conscious, or able to feel pain.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.1. Con: Not being self aware, conscious, and able to feel pain does not stop one from being a person with rights.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.1.1. Pro: People who [can't feel pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain#:~:text=Congenital%20insensitivity%20to%20pain%20\(CIP,has%20never%20felt\)%20physical%20pain.) qualify as people.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.1.2. Pro: People in a coma or people in an alive but unconscious state aren't disqualified as human or having less rights simply because they are not aware.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.1.2.1. Pro: It is definitely wrong to end the life of a person in a coma if the coma is reversible, and the person probably has a long life ahead of them.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.1.2.2. Con: It is always considered wrong to end the life of a healthy human being. It is not always considered wrong to end the life of someone who is in a coma.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.1.2.2.1. Pro: In many cases, the assisted death of someone is performed with the intent of [ending suffering](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/euthanasia-and-assisted-suicide/)(Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering.\n\nFor example, it could be considered euthanasia if a doctor deliberately gave a patient with a terminal illness a drug they do not otherwise need, such as an overdose of sedatives or muscle relaxant, with the sole aim of ending their life.) \(often of patients with a terminal illness\).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.1.2.2.1.1. Con: This is not relevant to fetal personhood because the baby is not suffering, and therefore the justification for taking a life in that case doesn't apply here.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.1.2.3. Pro: The claim that consciousness is necessary for rights confuses the source of rights with the effect of that source. The root of rights is human nature.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.1.2.3.1. Pro: Consciousness is an effect not a cause of human nature. Nor is evidence of consciousness the only evidence of human nature.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.2. Con: The referenced material is very far from being the unanimous definition of personhood.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.2.1. Pro: Personhood is a variable concept depending on one's personal philosophy, and so should not be used as a benchmark for assigning value to human life.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3. Pro: It is not until [28-30 weeks](https://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/Fulltext/2006/01170/When_Does_A_Fetus_Feel_Pain_.3.aspx) into the pregnancy that the fetus [starts to feel pain](https://www.livescience.com/54774-fetal-pain-anesthesia.html). A woman should have the right to an abortion, as long as it's before that time.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1. Con: Killing people is still considered unethical even if the victim doesn't feel pain.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1. Con: Ethics and morality are subjective and can vary from society to society or even from person to person.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.1. Con: Different people can hold different opinions of ethics, however that does not mean they are all equally correct and does not prove the subjectivity of ethical rules.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Ethics can [vary](https://www.intheblack.com/articles/2017/07/01/how-does-culture-affect-ethics) from culture to culture, with some slavery, for example. However, the underlying moral standards of right and wrong do not vary, even if a culture chooses not to base its ethics in those moral principles.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no indication to believe that there are moral standards of right and wrong.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: There is [large debate](https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/morality/what-is-objective-morality-what-can-it-teach-us/) about the existence of objective morality.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Under this thinking you could do whatever you want, whenever you want, and for whatever reason you want, no matter how many people get hurt, killed, or taken advantage of in the process.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Most relevant definitions of "subjective" state that something is subjective if different people can hold different opinions on the matter. If people can hold different opinions on whether or not abortion is immoral or unethical, it is subjective according to [those definitions](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/subjective).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.2. Pro: No one can dictate a certain morality to another person nor can they demand how another person acts or how they should feel based on their individual morals.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.1.3.3.1.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.4. Pro: As with all acts, the morality of abortion varies with the person's context.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.4.1. Con: Many argue that morality is not subjective when it comes to [causing harm](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/excellent-beauty/201712/morality-is-objective). If abortion causes harm to the fetus then the context does not matter.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.4.2. Pro: In an instance where the pregnant woman's life is at risk and the fetus would not survive on it's own, utilitarianism argues that an abortion would be more ethical than letting both the woman and the fetus die.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: The basis of utilitarianism argumentation would be that the overall good of saving the woman's life outweighs any unethical implications of abortions.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.3.3.4.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.4.2.3. Con: The utilitarian argument is not the only basis in determining the ethical implications of abortion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.4.2.3.1. Pro: There are [many reasons](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ethics-everyone/201506/whats-wrong-utilitarianism) why utilitarianism may be flawed.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.4.2.3.2. Con: Utilitarian evaluations are relevant to many people, particularly utilitarians, whether they are the sole basis for every person's opinion or not.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.5. Con: [Morality](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moral) by definition is not subjective. Preferences are entirely subjective and are neither right or wrong, they are just different tastes. Morality assumes "right" is not "wrong" and vice versa. Whenever a person assumes something is right they are assuming it is not wrong thus automatically proving a standard.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.2. Con: Fetuses can feel pain [well before that](https://oneofus.eu/expert-tells-congress-unborn-babies-can-feel-pain-starting-at-8-weeks/).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.2.1. Con: The support for this argument is a single testimony provided in an article written by an organization prejudiced against abortion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.2.2. Pro: A [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27881927/) concludes that from the 15th week of gestation onward, “the fetus is extremely sensitive to painful stimuli," and this should be considered when performing invasive medical procedures on the fetus to prevent suffering.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.4. Con: A fetus develops during the gestational period such that it does gain self-awareness and consciousness. Therefore it can still be argued it should qualify for personhood status while still in utero.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.4.1. Pro: The fetal stage of human development is about 8-40 weeks from conception. [Cortical function](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19566501/)(Cortical functions are well-defined for primary cortical areas like motor, sensory and visual functions. More complex cortical functions like language and to some degree memory are also well clarified.) is present by 30 weeks.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.4.2. Pro: A fetus develops the capacity for self-awareness and consciousness around the beginning of the [second trimester](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/the-moment-a-baby-s-brain-starts-to-function-and-other-scientific-answers-on-abortion-1.3506968)(The very beginnings of our higher brain structures only start to appear between weeks 12 and 16. Crucially, the co-ordinated brain activity required for consciousness does not occur until 24-25 weeks of pregnancy.). Thus, it should be regarded as having the unalienable right to life.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.4.2.1. Con: While it is true that a fetus develops sentience in utero, it does not have sentience from the moment of conception. Therefore, a fetus should not be considered a person prior to the development of sentience which roughly coincides with the beginning of the 2nd trimester.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.4.3. Con: Many non-human animals have cognitive capacities well beyond those of a fetus. These capacities are not typically taken to be sufficient for a right to life in the case of animals so it is unclear why they ought to be sufficient in the case of fetuses.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.4.3.1. Con: It's very clear why cognitive capacities are sufficient for a fetus and not sufficient for an animal. A fetus is a human and an animal is not. Human rights are not the same as animal rights.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.4.3.1.1. Pro: For example, "right to life" does not exist among animal rights. One can euthanize their dog.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.7. Pro: Human development is a continuum, except at conception and at birth, which are the only possible candidates for the beginning of personhood. Many people agree that late-term fetuses are persons, meaning that personhood must begin at conception.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.7.1. Con: There is no discontinuity in human development between adolescence and adulthood, yet we still recognize them as distinct phases of life. There's no rule saying a phase change requires discontinuity.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.7.1.1. Con: It is recognized that embryo, fetus and child are distinct phases of life, exactly like adolescence and adulthood are. The point is that human life is equaly valuable in all of its phases; old age, adulthood, adolescence, childhood, newborn, fetus, embryo.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.7.2. Con: There is a discontinuity. At first the fetus is unable to survive on its own outside the body of the mother. Then at some point the baby is able to survive on its own.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.7.2.1. Con: It is not entirely clear at what stage during the pregnancy this occurs, making it difficult to draw a line about when abortion would and would not be acceptable based on this.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.7.2.2. Con: 'At some point' is not a true discontinuity anymore than a bird flying at some point or a joey leaving the pouch at some point is. It is just a mark of growth, not a discontinuous stage like a larva or chrysalis would be.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.7.2.3. Con: Survival is a poor criteria to determine the beginning of a human life. Newborns cannot survive on their own either.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.7.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.1.3.4.2.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7. Con: Even if the fetus is a life, so is the mother. It is not clear that the right to life of a fetus necessarily trumps the right to bodily autonomy and self-preservation of the mother.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1. Pro: It is likely that most people would prioritize saving a human child over fertilized eggs. This shows that not all life is considered equal.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.1. Con: If people have to choose between saving a stranger adult and their own child, they are likely to save their own child. None of those two intuitions solve the moral problem.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.1.2. Con: The idea of choosing between a child and fertilized eggs is not analogous to real life. Even if a child's life is more valuable, it doesn't mean a fertilized egg or a fetus has no value and doesn't justify [abortion](https://www.dailywire.com/news/22360/pro-abortion-fanatic-presented-thought-experiment-ben-shapiro).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2. Con: All other things equal, the right to life should trump the right to bodily autonomy because the right to life is more fundamental than the right to bodily autonomy and the ending of one's life could also be seen as a violation of bodily autonomy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.2.1. Pro: Life is required first for one to have any other right, including autonomy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.3. Con: The fetus's rights should trump the mother's rights because the mother, in most pregnancies, is responsible for causing this conflict-of-rights situation.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.3.6.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4. Pro: It is impossible to give a fetus 'equal rights' to the person carrying it. To claim that a fetus has an inviolable right to life is to say that it should be born regardless of circumstances, even if it seriously harms or kills the pregnant person.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.4.3. Con: If the unborn child poses a risk to the life of the mother the aim is to deliver the child, not to kill it. This might pose an additional risk to the child if delivered very early but is not an abortion, e.g. aiming to kill the baby.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5. Pro: Women have a right to bodily autonomy and should ultimately be able to make choices about what happens to their bodies.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.1. Con: The fetus is not part of the woman's body but a separate entity, and therefore the woman is not just making a decision about her own body when it comes to abortion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.1.1. Con: If the child is a seperate entity to the pregant person, there exists no special moral obligation or relationship between them. They ought to be treated as strangers.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.1.1.1. Con: The relationship between a pregnant person and the fetus is not like that between strangers because the fetus is directly dependent upon the person to stay alive.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.3.1.1.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.1.1.2. Con: Unlike in the case of a stranger, a pregnant person, in some cases, makes a choice that leads to the pregnancy. As such, the moral relationship is not like that between strangers.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.1.1.3. Pro: If it turned out that one was a unique kidney donor match for someone, it would not be reasonable for the law to force that person to violate their bodily autonomy to save a life of "a separate entity".
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.1.1.3.1. Con: Pregnancy is a natural process and is not a permanent state, whereas losing a kidney is an artificial operation and is permanent. Therefore, they come with different obligations to others.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Neither naturalness or permanence are material factors that address bodily autonomy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Plausibly, permanence does impact bodily autonomy. If someone has permanently lost an organ through a violation of bodily autonomy they suffer the consequences of this for much longer.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.1.1.3.1.2. Con: It doesn't matter if a process is natural, since [appealing to naturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy) is a logical fallacy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.1.1.3.1.3. Pro: Pregnancy is a natural process which leads to the development of a child. Abortion requires actively interfering with this development, which is different to simply not acting to donate a kidney, even if it could save a life.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.1.1.3.2. Pro: If the fetus is not part of a woman's body, the woman inherently has the right to remove it from her body.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.1.2. Pro: Given this, the rights of the fetus cannot be subsumed by the pregnant person's right to bodily autonomy, much in the same way that people cannot violate each other's rights.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2. Pro: Denial of abortion rights is simply another way in which the patriarchy attempts to control what women do with their own bodies.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.1. Con: The fact many prominent pro-life groups such as [Live Action](https://www.liveaction.org/media/meet-lila-rose/), [Students for Life](https://www.kristanhawkins.com/), and [PLAGAL](https://www.plagal.org/) are lead by women makes it difficult to argue that the entire movement is controlled by the patriarchy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.1.1. Con: Women can also [uphold](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2011/05/22/women-damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-dont/)(A patriarchal bargain is a decision to accept gender rules that disadvantage women in exchange for whatever power one can wrest from the system. It is an individual strategy designed to manipulate the system to one’s best advantage, but one that leaves the system itself intact.) the patriarchy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Women may uphold the patriarchy when they get some sort of material benefit from doing so, but it is unclear what this benefit might be in the case of holding pro-life views.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.1.1.2. Pro: [Internalized misogyny](https://info.umkc.edu/womenc/2018/11/16/internalized-misogyny-what-does-it-look-like-how-do-you-stop-it/) is prevalent among women, on account of patriarchal structures, and can lead to [anti-abortion](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/18/from-alabama-to-armagh-women-are-on-the-front-line-in-the-war-on-abortion) attitudes.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.2. Con: If opposition to abortion is motivated by attempts to control women, it is unclear why pro life groups [also oppose human cloning and embryonic stem cell research](https://www.prolifewi.org/new-page) which have nothing specific to do with women.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.3. Con: Abortion is an instrument of the patriarchy. It's a way men can use women as objects of sexual pleasure and escape the responsibilities of fatherhood. Sometimes women may decide to get an abortion because of pressure or threats from the father.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.3.1. Con: [A survey of 1209 abortion patients](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2005/reasons-us-women-have-abortions-quantitative-and-qualitative-perspectives) found that fewer than 1% had abortions primarily because someone else insisted. Thus, in the majority of cases women would have their choice taken away by abortion being illegal, not legal.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.3.2. Pro: [A survey of 1000 women](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/01/31/sen-ted-cruz-democrats-are-now-so-radicalized-on-abortion-can-t-accept-any-limits-on-its-brutality.html) found 74% felt pressured by others while 30% chose abortion because they feared losing their man.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.4. Con: There is [very little percentage difference](http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/) between men \(42%\) and women \(38%\) who believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, or in the percentage of women \(59%\) and men \(55%\) who believe it should be legal in all/most cases. If the patriarchy is a factor at all, it is not a significant one.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.4.1. Con: There is a difference in the amount of men and women in [political positions](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/federal-employment-reports/reports-publications/executive-branch-employment-by-gender-and-racenational-origin/) that ultimately end up creating the laws surrounding these issues. The patriarchy isn't just ground-level, it's about a larger system of inherent bias, including positions of power \(aka the government\).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.4.2. Pro: Elizabeth Blackwell, an early feminist and [the first woman to get a medical degree](https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/elizabeth-blackwell), was also [strongly pro-life](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/letters-to-the-editor/2010/12/27/like-sarah-palin-early-feminists-were-pro-life). It is unlikely that she was a part of the patriarchy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.4.3. Con: Something being part of the patriarchy does not mean that it is believed or executed only or mostly by men. Slut-shaming is a clear example of this, being both an element of the patriarchal system and done by a vast number of women as well as men.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.5. Pro: Women's ability to carry children and give birth does not mean she should be limited or restricted by her reproductive functions in ways which men are not.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.5.1. Pro: By removing the ability of women to choose to opt out of pregnancies they do not desire, women become far more controlled by their reproductive systems.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.6. Pro: In patriarchal societies, women have experienced a great deal of [violence](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women) that involves assaulting their bodies through domestic violence or sexual assault. Giving women control over their bodies is an important step in acknowledging that they, not men, should be able to determine what happens to them.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.6.1. Con: Sexual assault and domestic violence are unfortunate. In these cases, the perpetrator should be given a fair trial and have to deal with appropriate punishments determined by the court.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.6.1.1. Con: Being forced into the life of a traumatized mother who didn't want to have it would punish the "baby" even more while further traumatizing the mother.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.3. Con: Legalised abortion could put some women in a position where they are coerced or forced to have an abortion that they do not want, which would also not give them bodily autonomy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.3.1. Pro: Legalized abortion gives parents an opportunity to blackmail their daughter to go through with an unwanted abortion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.3.2. Con: This is unlikely to be an issue in the vast majority of cases, and therefore it is still better to give women the ability to choose abortion, as many women want to, even though it may result in a small number being manipulated.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.3.3. Con: The idea that we should remove bodily autonomy to prevent the potential loss of bodily autonomy is the most categoric example of an oxymoron.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.3.3.1. Pro: Being coerced or forced to have an abortion in itself deprives the right of bodily autonomy regardless whether abortion is legalised or not.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.3.4. Con: It is far easier for someone to be forced into an illegal abortion \(due to the lack of criteria and consultation\) than it is to go through the process of obtaining a legal abortion without the coercion being picked up on.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.4. Pro: If women do not have the right to choose an abortion, someone else should not decide they have more of a right to deny them one.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.4.1. Con: A judge in a court of law has every right to prescribe the necessary course of action, whether they would or wouldn't like to be on the receiving end of the same judgement. Their obligation is to the law, not to the defendant.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.4.2. Con: By the same argument, an aborted child also has to live \(or rather die\) with their mother's decision and it's likely they would be far more offended themselves were they given the chance to be part of the discussion concerning their termination.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5. Pro: Women have a moral right to bodily autonomy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.1. Pro: Decisions which largely impact on an individual and their body should ultimately be made by that individual rather than by the state.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.1.1. Pro: The state allows individuals to make decisions even if they could harm other people.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: For example, people are not required to donate blood or put their life at risk to protect others even if it would save other people.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.1.1.2. Con: The state has the power to prevent actions that harm others, not to compel actions to prevent harm. The two are not the same.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: The law cannot compel someone to jump in and save a drowning man, but it can intervene if a person take actions to drown another person.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.1.1.3. Con: You are not required to put your life at risk to protect your child but you are required by law to take care of it. This argument supports the case for abortion where there is a high likelihood of death to the mother, but does not support a general right to choose abortion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2. Pro: Many women do not become pregnant by choice. It is wrong to force these women to remain pregnant when they do not want to be.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.1. Pro: Woman face too many [difficulties](https://www.bustle.com/p/can-doctors-refuse-tubal-ligation-heres-why-its-hard-to-get-one-to-tie-your-tubes-19233587) getting their tubes tied to be able to prevent pregnancies.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.2. Pro: Some pregnancies are the result of an act of violence like rape.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.2.2. Con: Often [healthcare professionals](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/childbirth-can-be-another-source-of-trauma-for-women-who-were-abused-1.4141804) are not educated on how to deal with women who have become pregnant on account of rape.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.2.3. Con: In the rare case of pregnancy due to rape, terminating the life of the unborn child will not correct the horror done to the woman, it will simply pass on the act of force to an innocent party.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.2.3.1. Con: Termination of the unborn child's life is not done to mitigate the effects of the crime on one's past, it is to minimize its effects on one's future.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: This is especially true for young teenagers that were raped by pedophiles; forcing a child into motherhood, on top of dealing with the sexual violence, would be unnecessarily cruel.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.2.4. Pro: In cases of non consensual sex, the person who was forced by someone to have sexual intercourse has no moral obligation to not kill the unborn-person. Every harm caused to the unborn is the responsibility of the person who forced the other to have sexual intercourse.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.2.4.1. Con: You cannot transfer responsibility for harm to another person. The person responsible for the abortion is the person going to the clinic.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.2.5. Pro: Raped women often don't have an option to use birth control.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.2.5.1. Con: There are contraceptive methods, such as the morning after pill, which can be used to guard against the possibility of becoming pregnant following cases of rape.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.3. Con: If this were the case, an analogy could be drawn to men impregnating women. A boy could make several girls pregnant, say he did not choose to, and claim he has no obligation to support them.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.3.1. Con: This is a valid but separate argument about legally severing paternity obligations. Whether a man is legally obligated to provide support to a child is not equivalent to a woman being required to give up her bodily autonomy for someone else.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.3.2. Con: Having to carry a child for 9 months is not in any way comparable to paying child support as one has physical and emotional consequences while the other is a mere financial consequence.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.3.2.1. Con: Whether pregnancy is experienced as a burden or a joy, or whether financial support is a hardship or peanuts, is a matter of personal circumstance. These apples and pears should not be compared or weighed against each other.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.4. Pro: Some schools provide such inadequate sex education that some people may not realise sex leads to pregnancy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.4.1. Con: Then the solution is better education, not abortion. To justify an act simply because it remedies a negative event based on a lack of education is simply lazy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.4.1.1. Con: The reason for abortion doesn't need to be "justified" if you do not see it as immoral. Poor education would merely be an explanation, and abortion the remedy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.4.1.2. Pro: It is unreasonable to be satisfied with poor education, but this leaves justification for it though a workaround.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.4.2. Pro: A report found evidence abstinence-only curricula promoting irresponsible, high-risk teenage behavior by keeping teens uneducated with regard to reproductive knowledge instead of giving them the tools to make educated decisions regarding their reproductive health \[[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3194801/#pone.0024658-Kaye1)\].
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.3.6.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.3. Pro: We do not give people the right to use other's people's body to use or sustain them without express and ongoing consent. If women want to remove that consent, they should be able to do so by having an abortion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.1.3.2.2.3.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.4. Con: The state limits bodily autonomy and the actions of individuals through laws such as banning drugs, in recognition that this is best for society.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.4.1. Pro: Legally, you can't do anything you want to with your body. For example, prostitution is [illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_by_region) in many places.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.4.1.1. Con: Prohibitions against prostitution do not prevent one from having sex with someone else; but prohibits the consideration \(in the contractual sense\) of money or property. Thus, the criminality of prostitution is a commercial law, not a restriction on bodily autonomy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.4.2. Con: Some societies have decriminalized drug use \([Portugal](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2050324516683640)\) or sex work \([Netherlands, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decriminalizing_sex_work#Legal_models_of_sex_work)\) because they recognize that criminalizing this behavior doesn't help people and can harm society.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.4.3. Con: Society cannot trample the individual on a whim. It is generally [recognized](https://legaldictionary.net/strict-scrutiny/) that the individual has specific rights that society cannot overrule without what is referred to in law as an "overriding state interest".
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.6. Pro: Women have a legal claim to a right to abortion.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.6.1. Pro: Individual freedom is the basis of the [US constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution). There is no right more fundamental then the choices we make about our own bodies. If we do not have that right, then none of the others matter.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.4.1.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.6.1.2. Pro: In the US, the Supreme Court decided that [bodily autonomy was an unenumerated right](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/personal_autonomy)(In Planned Parenthood v. Casey \(1992\), the Court emphasized the impact that Roe v. Wade \(1973\) had on the importance of personal autonomy, especially with regard to reproductive rights. The Casey Court wrote, "\[I\]f Roe is seen as stating a rule of personal autonomy . . . \[then the Supreme Court's\] post-Roe decisions accord with Roe's view that a State's interest in the protection of life falls short of justifying any plenary override of individual liberty claims . . . "\[N\]o erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left Roe's central holding a doctrinal remnant.") that could be inferred from privacy protections in the constitution.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.6.2. Pro: Banning abortion betrays the role of government as preserving liberty as stated in [the Declaration of Independence](http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.7. Pro: The only reliable basis we have on which to consider this issue is in relation to a woman's right to bodily autonomy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.7.1. Pro: We lack the necessary philosophical understanding to determine conclusively when sentience begins in a meaningful way.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.8. Con: Bodily autonomy is not an unlimited or absolute right.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.8.1. Pro: Individual liberty ends where another individual's liberties begin. As biology holds that a human life begins at conception, regardless of where one stands on the personhood or value of that life, the woman's freedom to make choices cannot supersede the liberty and rights of the human life inside her.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.8.1.1. Pro: In the ~87% of cases where rape \(1%\) and maternal health \(12%\) were not cited as reasons for the abortion, bodily autonomy of the mother does not usurp bodily autonomy of the fetus \([p. 113](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/psrh/full/3711005.pdf)\).
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.8.1.2. Con: A baby's life begins at conception but its liberty begins at birth. Until then its life depends on the mother's choices just like her own life. In fact they are biologically one.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.8.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.2.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.8.1.2.2. Con: Even after birth, the baby is still dependant on the mother. It is even more dependant because no longer feeds by itself from the mother's nutrients as it did during pregnancy.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.8.1.3. Con: Modern society could not sustain a position of individual liberty before birth. These individuals would need to be identified \(i.e. Social Security numbers\) and provided with the rights and applicable services of other born individuals.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.8.1.3.1. Con: Modern society is able to adapt to providing the unborn with rights, services, and a social security number or other form of identification.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.8.1.4. Con: Civil rights only apply to members of a society. A fetus is not an independently viable organism, so it cannot be a member of such a society. It therefore has no legitimate claim on the right to liberty.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.8.1.4.1. Con: Newborn infants are not independently viable either, and yet, we accept them as part of society.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.8.2. Con: Even if bodily autonomy is not unlimited this does not make any argument as to whether making abortion illegal is an appropriate limitation.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.6. Con: It is likewise not clear that the maternal right to bodily autonomy and self preservation necessarily trumps the fetus' right to life. This is the crux of the entire debate and may be unresolvable.
1.1.6.4.1.2.3.2. Con: This is an overly optimistic view. Childhood neglection, violence and trauma can amount to an ordeal that is all but destroying a child from within.
1.1.6.4.2. Pro: If abortion is banned, there will be two people suffering long term instead of one, as the mother has been forced to have a child and the child has to deal with the emotional toll of being unwanted.
1.1.6.5. Pro: Studies have shown that abortion has adverse psychological impacts on women.
1.1.6.5.1. Con: A 2017 study of a cohort of [Dutch women](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1363/psrh.12028) found no correlation between having an abortion and future mental health difficulties.
1.1.6.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.1.1.1.
1.1.6.5.3. Con: There might also be 'mental and physical consequences' if a woman has a baby she does not want. It is up to the woman to decide which course of action will cause them the least harm and she should be provided adequate information in order to do so.
1.1.6.5.3.1. Pro: PPD can, in its serious form, result in postpartum psychosis \(1/1000\). Psychosis is one of the leading reasons for murdering children in the first year. It makes no sense to make something illegal on the basis that there is some small risk to mental and physical well being as a side effect of a medical treatment.
1.1.6.5.4. Pro: A recent study, limited in scope to self-reporting by 987 women visiting CareNet pregnancy centers, found that only 13% of the women had visited a psychologist, psychiatrist, or counselor pre-abortion, but 67.5% sought care post-abortion \([p. 115](https://www.jpands.org/vol22no4/coleman.pdf)(Among the 987 respondents, 13% reported having visited a psychiatrist, psychologist, or counselor prior to the first pregnancy resulting in an abortion, compared to 67.5% who sought such professional services after their first abortion.)\).
1.1.6.5.5. Pro: A [survey study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3395931/) of 278 women in Tehran post-abortion found that one-third experienced negative psychological side-effects following an abortion.
1.1.6.5.5.1. Pro: Of this third, 60.5% reported depression, 48.7% reported developing an eating disorder, 43.7% reported decreased self-esteem, 39.5% reported having nightmares, 37.5% reported feelings of guilt, and a third expressed regret.
1.1.6.5.5.2. Con: There are issues with this study. It's a very small sample, only 278 women, and its purpose is "detecting types and frequent psychological side effects of abortion among post abortion care seeking," so everyone involved will have something negative to say or they would not be seeking post abortion care.
1.1.6.5.5.3. Con: Another [survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2580059/) on 192 non-pregnant woman shows the effects of unwanted pregnancy on women. 28% were willing to trade time from the end of their life, 16% of women were willing to accept an immediate risk of death and 60% of women were willing to pay some amount of money to avoid pregnancy.
1.1.6.5.5.4. Con: An important part of the mental consequences of abortion are related to the fact that right now it is [taboo](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/276266187.pdf)(Controversies related to \nsexuality and unintended pregnancies are encompassed in religious, political and social \nrealms. The nexus of these three realms work to maintain the taboo status of any topic \nrelated to sex thereby forming an unwritten rule that sexuality should not be talked about \npublicly or privately. Privately, individuals have risked unintended pregnancy or even \ntheir lives rather than risk the ―embarrassment‖ of talking with their partner about \ncondoms \(Reel & Thompson, 1994\) or disclosing their sexual history \(Lucchetti, 1999\).). Legalizing it puts the problem on the table and thus makes it easier for women to talk about it or deal with post-abortion.
1.1.6.5.5.4.1. Con: Many actions are taboo and have negative consequences. This does not mean they should be legalized.
1.1.6.5.5.4.2. Con: There is no evidence that the consequences of abortions are caused by its taboo status.
1.1.6.5.5.4.2.1. Con: Recent research suggests that two out of three pregnant persons who have abortions anticipate [stigma](https://abguide.uchicago.edu/page/understanding-abortion-stigma-and-shame) if others were to learn about it. In a large US survey, 58% of pregnant persons felt they needed to keep their abortion secret from friends and family and 17% believed their regular healthcare provider would treat them differently if they knew about the abortion.
1.1.6.5.5.4.3. Pro: The mental problems often arise because of the conflict with society itself. Women who chose an abortion are too often told that they do something wrong and immoral. It's only understandable and normal that someone who is forced to hear such things will develop mental issues.
1.1.6.5.5.4.3.1. Pro: If society itself was more understanding towards this topic there would be less mental problems after choosing an abortion.
1.1.6.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.
1.1.6.5.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.5.
1.1.6.6. Pro: Women can face severe bodily harm as a result of abortion.
1.1.6.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.6.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.1.6.6.3. Con: The same could be said of any sort of comparable surgery or medical procedure. Yet such procedures are still morally acceptable to do.
1.1.6.6.4. Pro: There can be immediate and long-term [medical consequences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430793/) of abortion.
1.1.6.6.4.1. Con: This is a reason for safe and easy access to abortion, so that surgery is not required. Between 2-10 weeks the mother can have a [medical abortion](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325582#medical-abortion).
1.1.6.6.4.2. Pro: Having an abortion can make people [significantly more likely](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/women-who-have-abortions-more-likely-have-premature-births-later-pregnancies-8104824.html)(Women who terminate their first pregnancy with an abortion are at greater risk of giving birth prematurely later in their lives compared to women who do not have an abortion, a study has found.\n\nScientists said that aborting a first pregnancy increases the chances of a spontaneous pre-term birth in a later pregnancy by nearly 40 per cent.) to have pre-term births.
1.1.6.6.4.3. Pro: After abortions, people may be at risk of [facing infections](https://www.132healthwise.com/understanding-the-risk-of-infection-after-an-abortion.php)(Some women do experience more serious complications after abortions. The main risk is infection, which can happen after both medical and surgical abortions. Infections happen when germs such as bacteria get into your body. Abortions can make it easier for germs to get in. Infections can also develop is any material is left behind in the womb after the abortion.).
1.1.6.6.4.4. Pro: During abortion operations, people may suffer from [organ damage](https://pregnancychoice.org/abortion/abortion-risks/)(he cervix and/ or uterus may be cut, torn, or punctured by abortion instruments. This may cause excessive bleeding requiring surgical repair. Curettes and other abortion instruments may cause permanent scarring of the uterine lining.).
1.1.6.6.4.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.6.6.4.6. Con: There are always potential consequences of medical treatments and operations. However, we allow people to opt into these even when they are not medically necessary, such as with plastic surgery.
1.1.6.6.4.6.1. Pro: The decision to undergo such a medical treatment or operation should be made by the individual woman, with full information provided by medical professionals.
1.1.6.6.4.7. Con: Legal abortions performed in the developed world are among the [safest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion#Safety) procedures in medicine.
1.1.6.6.4.7.1. Pro: A [2012 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22270271) in the US found that from 1998-2005 induced abortion had a maternal mortality rate of 0.6 deaths per 100,000 abortions, compared to a maternal mortality rate for pregnancy and childbirth of 8.8 deaths per 100,000 live births.
1.1.6.6.5. Pro: Women with an abortion history are at an increased risk of sexual dysfunction and face problems related to sexual desire, frequency of sexual intercourse, orgasm ability, and sexual satisfaction \([p. 1192](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0001-6349.2004.00494.x)(In a longitudinal Swiss study of 103 women, 31% presented one or more sexual symptoms 6 months after TOP: decrease of desire, reported by 18%, was associated with general anxiety, increased anxiety for sexual relations and low satisfaction with sexual intercourse before TOP.)\).
1.1.6.6.5.1. Pro: More than 30% of women in a Swiss longitudinal study reported a minimum of one sexual problem six months after an abortion \([p. 4](https://www.imfcanada.org/sites/default/files/Interconnected_May2014_1.pdf)\).
1.1.6.6.5.2. Con: WECARE, the organization behind the linked study, is an anti-abortion organization founded by a researcher who has been widely discredited. Her research finding a link between abortion and adverse health outcomes has been [debunked](https://rewire.news/article/2014/11/13/anti-choice-science-big-tobacco-time/).
1.1.6.6.6. Con: Doctors can and should inform patients of the risks in any operation. The presence of these risks doesn't change the right of the patient to make an informed choice.
1.1.6.6.7. Pro: As the fetus becomes more developed, there is a greater risk that an abortion will result in [health risks and complications](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/10015#.WhrwQEpl86w) for the mother.
1.1.6.6.7.1. Con: The easier it is for women to have abortions, the earlier they will take place.
1.1.6.6.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.6.
1.1.6.7. Pro: There is an [increased risk of maternal death](https://afterabortion.org/multiple-abortions-increase-risk-of-maternal-death-new-study/) after an abortion.
1.1.6.7.1. Con: This study doesn't control for [socioeconomic factors](https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/23/4/569/427991?login=true)(Because of the exploratory nature of the current study, only the most obvious control variables were used. However, more focused follow-up studies should be devoted to identifying a wide range of demographic, personal and situational factors that may be vital to control in subsequent analyses of associations between reproductive history patterns and death rates.). Healthcare, and as such abortions, are strongly correlated with socioeconomic factors \([p. 172](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2150131917697439)\).
1.1.6.7.2. Pro: A [Danish study](https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/23/4/569/427991?login=true) found an increased risk of maternal death of 45% for women who had an abortion compared to those who had not, after controlling for other reproductive outcomes.
1.1.6.8. Pro: Abortion [increases the risk of placenta previa](http://afterabortion.org/2012/abortion-risks-abortion-complications-abortion-dangers-abortion-side-effects/) in later pregnancies \(a life threatening condition for both the mother and her wanted pregnancy\) by seven to fifteen fold.
1.1.6.8.1. Con: The source referenced above is not neutral. It is provided by [Elliot Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reardon#Elliot_Institute), an [anti-abortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movement) think tank.
1.1.6.8.2. Pro: Abnormal development of the placenta due to uterine damage increases the risk of fetal malformation, perinatal death, and excessive bleeding during labor.
1.2. Pro: There are many reasons a woman may not be equipped to or want to raise a child. In these cases, it is important that she is able to choose abortion.
1.2.1. Pro: A woman may not feel emotionally, mentally or otherwise prepared to have a child, and ultimately this could be damaging for the child and for the relationship between the mother and child.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Some women may not have the financial resources to go through a pregnancy and then support a child sufficiently.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Men are equally responsible for pregnancy but are often unwilling to fulfil their paternal role. When this occurs, an unplanned pregnancy can lead to socio-economic hardship for mother and child.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: This is an argument for the state providing more support for mothers rather than for allowing abortion.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Many countries do provide [child benefits](https://www.euronews.com/2018/08/17/which-country-has-the-highest-child-benefits-available-to-foreigners-) which can help parents with the financial costs of raising a child.
1.2.1.1.2.2. Con: Humans live in societies, not in abstract environments devoid of constraints. Therefore, forgetting this environment would be a mistake: if the state is unable to provide support for mothers \(for any reason, let it be economic situation or established laws\), abortion would enable better financial survival of mothers.
1.2.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: To follow this logic; forgetting that the environment includes a second subject in this debate, as well as the mother, would also be a mistake. If the mother is unable to provide support for the child, adoption would enable better survival of babies.
1.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: The money spent on providing free or reduced cost abortion services can be spent on publicly funded aid for mothers and/or the children that were born as a result of an unwanted pregnancy.
1.2.1.1.2.4. Con: Arguing that the government should provide more support for new parents doesn't resolve the question of what decisions a pregnant person should make \(or be allowed to\) in the conditions they are currently experiencing. Even if there were more supports for parents that doesn't justify coercing them to gestate to term.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: Throughout history most people lived in far poorer conditions, yet managed to raise more children per household than we do today.
1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: People's economic standing, literacy and health have [improved](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2016/12/23/14062168/history-global-conditions-charts-life-span-poverty) in the last two centuries.
1.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: Individuals have more choice and [freedom](https://sciencenorway.no/forskningno-history-norway/was-everything-better-in-the-past/1443902) today, which allows people to improve their conditions more easily than those in the past.
1.2.1.1.3.3. Con: Demographics have changed. Even though birthrate was high at that time, death rate of children was also very [high](https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality). Therefore a lot of them were not raised, they died before maturity. On the contrary, today, it's no longer necessary to have a lot of children to ensure descendants.
1.2.1.1.3.4. Con: One of the reasons families were bigger in past centuries was because children could [provide for the household](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1116808/)(The introduction of child labour laws and then compulsory schooling, devised with other aims, hastened the control of family size by increasing spending on children and reducing their earning potential.) at a much younger age and without having most of the qualifications that are necessary now. Nowadays having a child implies supporting them until they finish a degree and even that is no guarantee of success. The world simply does not work that way anymore.
1.2.1.1.3.4.1. Con: Supporting them until they finish a degree is an exaggeration. There are no age restrictions on certain types of jobs in the U.S. At 14, they can work limited hours at any non hazardous job. At 16, unlimited hours at any non-hazardous job. At 18, unlimited at any job. If they choose college, there are grants or loans that can pay their way if the parents can't.
1.2.1.1.4. Pro: [Research](https://www.ansirh.org/research/turnaway-study#results) by the University of California found that “turnaways,” meaning women denied abortions, were more likely to be in poverty two years later, compared to their peers who got the abortion services they sought.
1.2.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.
1.2.1.2. Con: Not being prepared to accept the consequences of your decisions and actions is not justification for terminating a human life. Both parents should accept the responsibility they brought upon themselves and prioritize the life they brought into the world. Mental and emotional readiness is something a person wills themselves into, not something that comes out of the blue one day.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.2.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: People are put in situations they are not ready to face all the time. They deal with them successfully by learning and adapting rather than running away from them.
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Overcoming challenges is what makes a person [stronger](http://resultsempowerment.com/4-benefits-of-facing-challenges/).
1.2.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.
1.2.1.3. Pro: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16713893) of children born between 1961-63 compared the adult mental health outcomes of those born to women who requested an abortion and those whose mother did not request an abortion. Significant differences in mental health outcomes were found, all demonstrating worse outcomes for the "unwanted" children.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: When abortion is allowed, the resulting children are killed. Death is a much harsher outcome than "a variety of social and psychological problems."
1.2.1.4. Con: A damaged, imperfect relationship or child would in most cases be better than no relationship or child.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: A damaged, imperfect relationship/child is likely to cause suffering for both the mother and child, whereas having no child would result in potentially less suffering. If a mother wanted to have an abortion then it is likely she is better off without having to raise the child.
1.2.1.5. Pro: Some girls [regret having become pregnant](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38775641) as they were too young and too unsettled to have a child at that time.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.1.1.2.
1.2.2. Pro: Bringing a child into the world has consequences not only restricted to the moment of birth but for the rest of the mother's life and for all the people around them.
1.2.2.1. Pro: [6 out of 10](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/considering-abortion) people who get abortions already have children, and many feel they need to dedicate their time and resources to the children they already have, rather than having another.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.ansirh.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/2014-9foster-unwanted-pregnancy-effects.pdf) by University of California shows that existing children of women denied an abortion have 4 percentage point lower scores across all six domains of child development.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Abortion can have a negative effect on living children.
1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Post-abortal women report that their ability to respond to the remaining or future child\(ren\) can be manifested in several ways: a feeling of emotional numbness which leads to a lack of bonding, acting out of hostility and anger which can result in child abuse, and considering future children as “replacement children” who become overindulged \([p. 11](http://www.deveber.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Chap15.pdf)\).
1.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: After abortion, “replacement” children may find themselves the object of obsessive [parenting styles](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/indexablecontent/uuid:204af9c9-18ec-450b-8680-7f19890eec5a) of post-abortal parents who focus inordinate time, affection, or material goods on them. Parents may attempt to replace the lost child with a “wanted” child soon after the abortion. This can be [detrimental](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791524/) to a child's development and behavior \([p. 13](http://www.deveber.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Chap15.pdf)\).
1.2.2.2. Con: A child also can have a negative impact on a mothers life, but this doesn't mean that is a legitimate reason to kill the child.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: It can not be said that ending the life of a living child, is equivalent to ending the life of an unborn child. The living child and the unborn child have very different sets of capacities \(self awareness, ability and conceptualize pain, ability to form social ties etc.\).
1.2.2.3. Pro: Many households experience a significant [decline](http://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/income-volatility-around-birth/) in economic well-being in the time around a birth. They face increased demands on resources, changes in the composition of income, and a potentially heightened risk of economic insecurity.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: The drop in parents’ [income](http://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/income-volatility-around-birth/) around childbirth can have major consequences for children as well. Inadequate family income is harmful for children—particularly young children—affecting their long-term social-emotional, cognitive, and academic outcomes \([p. 15](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/32706/412899-The-Negative-Effects-of-Instability-on-Child-Development-A-Research-Synthesis.PDF)\).
1.2.2.3.2. Con: Pregnancy and the growth in household size may trigger an increase in public program eligibility and benefit levels among economically disadvantaged households.
1.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: The Special Supplemental Nutritional Program for Women, Infants and Children \([WIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIC)\) is a federal assistance program that provides near-cash nutritional assistance targeted at this time period. It targets low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and children under the age of five.
1.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: Many major cash and near-cash safety net programs in USA including the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \([TANF](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/programs/tanf)\) program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \([SNAP](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap)\), the Earned Income Tax Credit \([EITC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit)\) and the Child Tax Credit \([CTC](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policy-basics-the-child-tax-credit)\), either restrict eligibility to households with children, or increase benefit levels when a new child is added to the assistance unit.
1.2.2.3.2.3. Con: Even in most of the developed countries, the social assistance that new mothers are entitled to is rarely sufficient on its own, especially if the mother was forced to give up her job to care for the child.
1.2.2.3.2.3.1. Pro: The amount an average single parent with two children receives in the [US](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37159686) is set by each state, with a 60 month lifetime limit. In Mississippi, they would receive $153 a month. In Alaska, the average benefit was $642 a month.
1.2.2.3.2.3.2. Pro: A single person with one child in Ontario, [Canada](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37159686) would receive a benefit of just less than $1,000 Canadian dollars a month, with no lifetime limit.
1.2.2.3.2.3.3. Pro: In [France](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37159686) a single parent with two children would be eligible for as much as €1,068.61 each month, but that benefit would be lessened by any actual income or other cash benefits the person was claiming.
1.2.2.3.2.3.4. Pro: In the [UK](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37159686), a single parent with two children could expect £292 a month. The person must have no income or low income, work less than 16 hours a week, and have savings of under £16,000.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Pregnancy and motherhood have a substantial impact on a woman’s career.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: A woman who gets pregnant, gives birth, and finds someone to adopt the child does not end up with a dependent child. However, having to raise a dependent child is what caused negative career outcomes for the women, not pregnancy by itself.
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: Once women return to work after giving birth, many women face a "[motherhood wage penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherhood_penalty),” especially at the bottom of the income spectrum. This means that working mothers encounter [systematic disadvantages](https://www.thirdway.org/report/the-fatherhood-bonus-and-the-motherhood-penalty-parenthood-and-the-gender-gap-in-pay#motherhood-wage-penalty-the-cost-of-each-additional-child-on-a-womans-wage) in pay, perceived competence, and benefits relative to childless women.
1.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: Mothers may trade higher wages for “mother-friendly” jobs that are easier to combine with parenting \([p. 204](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/media/_media/pdf/Reference%20Media/Budig_2001_Lifecourse.pdf)\).
1.2.2.4.2.2. Pro: The [work-effort theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherhood_penalty#Work-effort_theory) suggests mothers may earn less because they are less productive at work due to the needs of their children leaving them exhausted and distracted, or because they are saving their energy for their ["second shift"](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Second_shift).
1.2.2.4.3. Pro: Motherhood has a greater impact on a woman’s career prospects than her level of education, according to a study by the Young Women’s Trust. Women with a dependent child are six times more likely to be economically inactive than those without children \([p. 4](https://www.youngwomenstrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Young-female-forgotten-full-report.pdf)\).
1.2.2.4.3.1. Con: This is mainly due to patriarchal oppression, not the demands of motherhood. It is [possible](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0512/maternity-leave-basics-canada-vs.-the-u.s..aspx) to employ and educate mothers while giving them ample maternity leave, equal pay, and quality healthcare.
1.2.2.4.4. Pro: A [study](https://nypost.com/2017/02/27/this-one-tiny-thing-made-mens-careers-and-destroyed-womens/) at Cornell University shows that being a mother is proven to be a clear disadvantage when applying for jobs.
1.2.2.4.4.1. Pro: When a similar experiment was reproduced in laboratory settings, mothers were offered salaries of around $11,000 less than women without children. Fathers were offered salaries of around $2,000 more. \([p. 1316](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/getting_a_job-_is_there_a_motherhood_penalty.pdf)\)
1.2.2.4.5. Con: In most Western countries, there are [legal measures](https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/pregnant_workers.cfm) that allow women to retain their employment status and forbid discrimination based on having children.
1.2.2.4.5.1. Con: Taking maternity leave inherently [stalls](https://www.nct.org.uk/pregnancy/pregnancy-work/how-maternity-leave-and-pregnancy-affect-career-progression) one's career, even if there is not explicit discrimination.
1.2.2.5. Pro: Parenthood can have a negative impact on a marriage. The relationship between spouses may suffer once children come along.
1.2.2.5.1. Pro: Parenthood hastens [marital decline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2367106/) - even among relatively satisfied couples who select themselves into this transition. The rate of the decline in relationship satisfaction is nearly twice as steep for couples who have children than for childless couples.
1.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: In the event that a pregnancy is unplanned, the parents experience even [greater](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702669/) negative impacts on their relationship, including increase in relationship conflict and a decrease in love.
1.2.2.5.2. Con: Abortion can also have a negative impact on marriage and relationship.
1.2.2.5.2.1. Con: If the pregnant individual obtains an abortion, the other party likely either agreed to it, in which case they affirmatively assented to the risk of negative impact, or the relationship was already on rocky foundations such that obtaining the abortion could not have significant causal effect on its health.
1.2.2.5.2.1.1. Pro: If the pregnant individual did not seek the consent of the other person, they probably have a reason for doing so that suggests the relationship's foundations are not solid.
1.2.2.5.2.2. Pro: There is an increased risk for separation or divorce following an abortion \([p. 2](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b499/4a5f23c5c9da17418d51e341cec0ee8d3eb1.pdf)\).
1.2.2.5.2.2.1. Pro: A [study](http://www.lifeissues.net/writers/air/air_vol20no1_20071.html) by Rue and colleagues reported that out of 331 Russian and 217 American women, 6.8% of Russian women and 26.7% of American women indicated relationship problems caused by an abortion experience. 7.8% of Russian women and 19.8% of American women indicated that their relationships had ended as a direct consequence of the abortion.
1.2.2.5.2.3. Pro: Associations between abortion and relationship conflict are logical since [anger](https://www.healthline.com/health/post-abortion-syndrome#suggested-symptoms) is a common post-abortion emotional [response](https://ramahsvoice.com/5-types-anger-abortion/).
1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.
1.2.4. Pro: Many women may want to [commit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/abortion-right-to-privacy-women-right-to-equality) to work and education, without having to worry about getting derailed in life due to an unplanned pregnancy.
1.2.4.1. Con: Those women can avoid unplanned pregnancies through abstinence or use of contraception.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.
1.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Between 1970 and 1990 The Pill accounted for nearly three quarters of the increase in the number of women who became doctors and lawyers. The right to abortion contributed significantly to the same [phenomenon](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/abortion-right-to-privacy-women-right-to-equality).
1.2.4.3.1. Con: The contraceptive pill is not the same as abortion. Any attempt to equate them is misleading and incorrect.
1.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: Improved levels of education, increased demand for lawyers and doctors, changes in traditional beliefs that women should work, and TV shows depicting women doing more than just minding kids likely all contributed to an increase in women professionals too.
1.2.4.3.1.2. Con: The Pill and abortions are not equal, but in effect they complement each other - they give women the power to determine their readiness for reproduction.
1.2.4.3.1.3. Con: In the 1960s - when The Pill was introduced in the US - employers could \(without penalty\) fire a woman who got [pregnant](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/05/06/pogrebin.pill.roundup/index.html).
1.2.4.3.1.4. Con: With The Pill, large numbers of college women could embark on careers that involved long-term, up-front time commitments in education and training as physicians, lawyers, veterinarians, managers, and academics, among others. A pregnancy could derail a career, but The Pill enabled women to stay on [track](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/05/06/pogrebin.pill.roundup/index.html).
1.2.5. Con: There are cases where a woman feels like she is not equipped when in fact she is. In these cases she only needs more self confidence, not an abortion.
1.2.5.1. Con: The woman in question should be the one to decide what is best for her. If society sees her as able to handle the responsibility of raising a child, she should also be able to make other decisions concerning her own life.
1.2.5.2. Con: In the cases where the mother feels like she is not equipped, she would be better served by help and guidance, rather than being forced to go through it.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: There are well-known mothers in the news who were found to not be mentally equipped for the job at all. [Andrea Yates](http://time.com/4375398/andrea-yates-15-years-drown-children/), [Tamara Butler](https://caymannewsservice.com/2016/03/god-told-mother-to-kill-her-child/), and [Christina Treadway](http://people.com/crime/carolina-panthers-mom-killed-children-jumped-bridge/), for example. Pro-birth pundits should focus on care for mothers which would help both the born and unborn.
1.2.5.2.2. Con: The remote possibility that an extremely mentally deranged woman could end up doing terrible things is not a reason for a relatively healthy woman to have an abortion.
1.2.5.2.3. Con: These examples while horrific, are outliers, not representative of the general population. The vast majority of women are perfectly capable of raising children. Many do not see their own strength.
1.2.5.3. Pro: [Prenatal depression](https://www.beaumont.org/conditions/prenatal-depression) is a factor that might push a pregnant woman towards abortion. Were it to be treated she might decide otherwise.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: The fact that a [small percentage](https://www.beaumont.org/conditions/prenatal-depression)(About 13 percent \(more than one in 10\) of pregnant women and new mothers experience depression.) of women may suffer from prenatal depression is not a strong enough reason to deprive all women of the right to choose to have an abortion.
1.2.5.4. Pro: Some women may only need to see their own strength. They might end up seeing children as giving purpose and meaning to their life.
1.2.5.5. Con: It is not the place of society, legislators or the government to assert whether or not a woman needs confidence or an abortion. Passing laws based upon the assertion of what someone ought to do is a slippery slope that could lead to other assertions about what people ought to do.
1.2.5.6. Con: Women often have a multitude of sources to help them with this decision including friends, family, the father, a doctor, counselors and so on.
1.2.6. Con: If a mother is incapable of raising her child, it is both the moral and legal duty of the government to look after the child. By choosing to legalize abortion, the government is washing its hands of this responsibility. The government should uphold the sanctity of fundamental rights to even the unborn child.
1.2.6.1. Pro: The government has a duty to [protect and provide](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/02/government-responsibility-to-citizens-anne-marie-slaughter/) for its citizens.
1.2.6.2. Con: This reasoning indicates that there are no responsible stakeholders but the individual and the government, which is not true. The larger family and the individuals' communities can and do take on responsibilities to help the parents. The government can be expected to create an environment where all the stakeholders are enhanced for the good of the parents and the children.
1.2.6.3. Con: Some governments, such as the American one, can't afford healthcare, let alone raising all the children that parents don't want.
1.2.7. Pro: Pregnancy and parenthood are very [expensive](https://www.parents.com/parenting/money/family-finances/the-price-of-parenthood-an-exclusive-family-finances-survey/) and time consuming. Many women who get abortions are already mothers, and they want to provide the best care they can to their existing children, financially, emotionally, and physically. This should be their choice.
1.2.7.1. Con: If the fetus is already a child, then it follows from your argument that one should be able to terminate one's offspring to better provide for the rest. This is immoral, and therefore, abortion for the reasons you presented is immoral.
1.2.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.2.7.3. Con: A vasectomy or tubal ligation would be [adequate](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/features/vasectomy-tubal-litigation-options) and less harmful in this scenario.
1.2.7.3.1. Con: Some hospitals do not perform vasectomies or tubal ligations on religious grounds. \(e.g. Many Catholic hospitals in [Canada](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hospital-halts-abortion-birth-control-procedures-1.160978) and the [United States](http://www.times-standard.com/article/NJ/20170916/NEWS/170919863) have not performed these services in the recent past, see links.\) Therefore, this point only applies if these services are readily available and not themselves disallowed.
1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.
1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.5.2.
1.6. Pro: The ability of people to access abortion services, and have control over their own reproduction, is fundamental to achieving gender equality.
1.6.1. Pro: Society is better off if women only have the children they want and can raise well.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Abortion can help prevent the numerous financial issues that come from having an unplanned pregnancy.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Governments should provide support to families to ensure that abortion is not the only option and that these financial issues are not significant.
1.6.1.1.2. Pro: When women cannot afford to raise their children they are forced to go on welfare, which is a cost to everyone.
1.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.2.3.3.2.1.
1.6.1.1.2.2. Con: A case could be made that it would be better to have our tax dollars contributed to welfare, than have that same money be [contributed to abortion](http://www.theinterim.com/issues/abortion/how-much-does-abortion-cost-taxpayers/).
1.6.1.1.2.3. Con: Society is best when we look out for others. Supporting people who need it through welfare is not necessarily a bad thing.
1.6.1.1.3. Pro: Many women who become pregnant are still in high school and are [forced to drop out](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/teen-pregnancy-affects-graduation-rates-postcard.aspx).
1.6.1.1.4. Pro: Even if women are out of high school, unwanted pregnancy can force them to leave their jobs, furthering inequality in the workforce.
1.6.1.1.4.1. Pro: Women often have to [sacrifice](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/between-motherhood-and-career/article23936760.ece) their careers for childbearing and child-rearing which is not the case with men.
1.6.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.
1.6.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Studies suggest that among men with equivalent resumes, [fathers](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/upshot/a-child-helps-your-career-if-youre-a-man.html) are more likely to receive call-backs and higher wage offers than are childless men.
1.6.1.1.4.1.3. Con: This is a problem with culture and employment, not childbearing.
1.6.1.1.4.1.4. Con: It is false to suggest that future educational and career goals must be abandoned when one becomes pregnant. With the choice of adoption and the many [support](https://www.teensuccess.org/) [programs](https://www.gov.uk/care-to-learn/eligibility) which exist today, young women or teens can postpone their educational plans but still achieve them.
1.6.1.1.4.2. Con: Preference for equality in the workforce is not a satisfactory reason for abortion.  Many childless women are treated unequally in the workforce as it is.  We can strive for equality whilst also supporting childbearing.
1.6.1.1.4.2.1. Con: One of the reasons for unequal treatment of women in the workforce is the assumption that they will get [pregnant](https://qz.com/1686054/we-cant-talk-about-workplace-equality-when-we-still-punish-women-for-getting-pregnant/) and leave their job any time. If women are denied the option to terminate unwanted pregnancies, this further fuels such assumptions and encourages discrimination in the workplace.
1.6.1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The option to have an abortion gives women more autonomy over their careers, as it allows them to plan ahead and discuss maternity leave with their employers before actually needing it.
1.6.1.1.4.2.2. Con: Giving women the right to have an abortion if they want to does not oppose or contradict support for childbearing. Allowing women a choice does not make anything compulsory.
1.6.1.2. Con: Individuals contribute to society in numerous different ways, and even children that are not wanted or raised well may make valuable contributions that mean society is better off.
1.6.1.3. Con: It is possible to provide more education and access to resources and contraception to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies without relying on abortion.
1.6.1.4. Con: Even if society is better in some ways if women only have the children they want, this is not enough to justify killing the children. Otherwise, women would be permitted kill toddlers they are currently raising but don't want.
1.6.1.5. Pro: Denying women the right to terminate pregnancies at an early stage implies that giving birth to children is the most important thing a woman will ever do; that her ability to give birth trumps any other contribution to [society](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/abortion-right-to-privacy-women-right-to-equality) she could possibly make.
1.6.1.5.1. Con: Many women who have made [great contributions](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/79143/25-historys-greatest-moms) to society have done so as mothers.
1.6.1.5.2. Pro: Denying women access to safe, legal abortion in the interests of the embryo values the woman’s actual life less than the potential life of the embryo.
1.6.1.5.3. Con: Denial of the right to terminate a pregnancy says nothing about the relative importance of giving birth.
1.6.1.6. Pro: There is evidence to suggest that the Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion in 1978 was responsible for the dramatic decrease in violent crime the United States experienced through at least 1999 \([p. 414](http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DonohueLevittTheImpactOfLegalized2001.pdf)\).
1.6.1.6.1. Con: The ends do not justify the means. Using an immoral act \(abortion\) to justify a good \(improved crime rates\) is unethical.
1.6.1.6.2. Pro: Five US states legalised abortion three years before Roe v. Wade. Crime started falling three years earlier in these states, with property crime \(committed by younger people\) falling before violent [crime](http://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/).
1.6.1.6.3. Pro: There is evidence from Canada, Australia, and Romania that also supports the hypothesis that abortion reduces [crime](http://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/).
1.6.2. Con: Abortion worsens gender inequality.
1.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.7.5.2.3.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Considering this topic regards whether the woman has the right to choose to terminate life, and not whether the father has any say, then support of the woman's right alone to choose is not a step for gender equality, but rather increases gender inequality.
1.6.2.3. Con: Late undesired pregnancy impedes the woman of performing her professional activities for a considerable period of time, thus, making her dependent on her partner, institutions and her family.
1.6.2.4. Pro: In many countries, girls are more likely to be aborted, resulting in a disproportionate male-to-female ratio.
1.6.2.4.1. Pro: When women are more likely to be aborted, this normalizes a narrative that women's lives are less important.
1.6.2.4.1.1. Con: These narratives are being [challenged](https://opentextbc.ca/womenintheworld/chapter/chapter-12-rights-of-the-girl-child/) and [measures](http://www.iccwtnispcanarc.org/upload/pdf/8929239093PREVENTIVE_MEASURES_FOR_FEMALE_FOETICIDE.pdf) are being taken to prevent sex-selective abortions.
1.6.2.4.1.2. Pro: In [China](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11393782/China-and-gender-abortion-Government-policy-isnt-the-answer.html), sons are often seen as more desirable. This is particularly the case in rural areas where sons are valued because of their ability to perform manual and agricultural work.
1.6.2.4.2. Con: This argument is easily separated from the larger argument by making it illegal to determine the sex of the fetus in these countries as is the case in countries like [India](http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sex-determination-an-old-law-a-new-debate/) already.
1.6.2.4.2.1. Con: This approach undermines the freedom of couples to properly plan for their baby. There are legitimate medical and social reasons to find out the baby's sex ahead of time \(e.g. preparing older siblings, intersex children, pure curiosity\) that do not involve sex-based abortion. This unfairly limits all couple's options to prevent some couples from discriminatory abortions.
1.6.2.4.3. Pro: In [India](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530074-400-technology-driving-rise-in-abortions-of-girls-in-india/), approximately 10 million girls were aborted between 1991 and 2011, which has led to there being 914 girls to every 1000 boys by 2011.
1.6.2.4.3.1. Con: This says more about gender equality than about the right of abortion. If there is a preferred gender, then that is the issue, not the abortion.
1.6.2.4.3.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21612820) found that in Indian families where the firstborn was a girl, the second child was unnaturally likely to be a boy, whereas if the firstborn was a boy, sex ratios among subsequent children were normal.
1.6.2.4.3.2.1. Pro: The [study](http://The study also found that second boys were not aborted, only second girls.) also found that second boys were not aborted, only second girls.
1.6.2.4.3.3. Pro: A [study](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2083801-records-reveal-gender-selective-abortion-taking-place-in-canada/) found that some Indian-born immigrants in Canada are electively aborting female fetuses if they have already had two daughters.
1.6.2.4.3.3.1. Con: The incidence of this is low, and the practice is likely to go away on its own as immigrants become [settled](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2083801-records-reveal-gender-selective-abortion-taking-place-in-canada/).
1.6.3. Pro: If a woman is not allowed to have an abortion, she is not only forced to continue the pregnancy to birth, but also expected by society to support and look after the resulting child for many years to come.
1.6.3.1. Pro: In a [majority](http://blog.optionscorp.com/data-shows-that-women-are-primary-caregivers-of-family/) of cases, a mother is the primary caregiver of a child and has to invest more time and energy in taking care of the child.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.4.1.
1.6.3.1.2. Con: What is true for the majority may not apply in every case - a father may wish to take on the role of a child's primary caregiver.
1.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: There are [increasing numbers](https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/number-of-stay-at-home-dads-rising-466393.html) of fathers who wish to be stay at home parents.
1.6.3.1.2.2. Pro: The introduction of paternity leave in some countries has seen a rise in the number of men taking time off work to raise their children \([p. 16](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/aid_development_cooperation_fundamental_rights/parental_leave_in_iceland_compilation_of_reports_2008_en.pdf)\).
1.6.3.1.3. Pro: [Many](https://www.fatherhood.org/fatherhood-data-statistics) fathers leave their children behind, leaving the mothers to care for them on their own.
1.6.3.1.3.1. Con: Father absence is a cultural problem in its own right, but no reason to preemptively abort.
1.6.3.2. Con: Fathers are held financially responsible for their children. It is not only mothers who are forced to take care of the unwanted children.
1.6.3.2.1. Con: Only [50% of single parents](https://www.verywellfamily.com/us-child-support-statistics-2997994) have a child support agreement in place with the other parent of their child in the US, which shows that it is difficult to enforce financial responsibility.
1.6.3.2.2. Pro: Fathers have to help fund and support the child until they are no longer a [dependent](https://www.cleo.on.ca/en/publications/childsupport/how-long-does-child-support-continue), usually 18 years, which would add to the emotional burden on the father and the father's family.
1.6.3.3. Pro: In certain religious households where abstinence is an important virtue, women who get pregnant out of wedlock are [shunned](https://www.news24.com/Columnists/Landisa/landisa-i-was-shunned-for-getting-pregnant-out-of-wedlock-i-finally-know-it-does-not-define-me-20191206). This leaves pregnant women with very little financial and emotional support, while forcing them to be the sole provider for the child.
1.6.4. Con: Better access to contraception and improved sexual education would [reduce the risk](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/94/d7/94d748c6-5be0-4765-9d38-b1b90d16a254/reducing_teen_pregnancy.pdf) of unplanned pregnancies.
1.6.4.1. Con: The issue is that these resources are not properly allocated or presented to the populace. Women should not be made to suffer because of a failure of government.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.
1.6.4.2. Con: Abortion would not disappear no matter how accessible birth control and adoption becomes.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: [Sweden's abortion statistics](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/ab-sweden.html) show that abortions will still happen, even in spite of the fact that many parts of the country [provide](http://gynopedia.org/Sweden) heavily subsidised birth control for women up to their mid-twenties, free condoms at clinics, and free abortions up to 25-26.
1.6.4.3. Con: Access to contraception will not help when many religious and cultural circles demand abstinence. Young women may have access to contraception but choose not to carry or use it because they are at a higher risk of being caught and punished for being sexually active.
1.6.4.3.1. Con: A lot of those circles also ban abortion, so the justification of abortion by citing these situations is a fallacy. They already stigmatise abortion and demand carrying to full term, so they are an irrelevant factor in the discussion.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Abortion is a band-aid solution to systemic issues in society. While it may need to remain legal, it does nothing to address the reasons behind unwanted pregnancy.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.8. Con: Men have a large stake in the fetus, so they should have a say regarding whether a woman has an abortion.
1.8.1. Con: Men can have a say regarding pregnancy, they just don't get to be the deciding vote, nor do they get to be coercive or place the individual who is pregnant under extra duress.
1.8.1.1. Pro: A father should not have the authority to force the mother to have an abortion; thus, the corollary, forcing the mother to not have an abortion, is equally unacceptable.
1.8.2. Con: The man in each situation is almost always entirely at fault for the undesired pregnancy due to irresponsible ejaculation. This indicates they do not possess the necessary decision-making capacity to contribute to the decision of whether or not a woman obtains an abortion.
1.8.3. Pro: If a child is brought into the world sharing the father's DNA, that man feel an obligation to be involved even if they did not want children. This can have a big impact on their life as well as the mother's.
1.8.4. Con: -> See 1.6.3.1.
1.8.5. Pro: Men are [far less likely](https://www.divorcenet.com/resources/divorce/for-men/divorce-for-men-why-women-get-child-custody-over-80-time) to obtain custody, and far more likely to be required to provide child support. Due to these statistics, fathers should have a voice in the abortion process.
1.8.5.1. Pro: The decision to bring a child into the world is a big one given it is not possible to predict what will happen in a relationship, and given men are less likely to obtain custody.
1.8.5.2. Pro: When considering what is in the [best interests of the child](https://www.divorcenet.com/resources/divorce/for-men/divorce-for-men-why-women-get-child-custody-over-80-time), mothers are often considered the most appropriate custodian given they are likely to be the primary caregiver, even if the father is very involved.
1.8.5.3. Con: This only applies to when women choose not to abort. However, when women choose to abort, there is no physical, financial, or legal consequence to the man. Therefore that choice should be in the hands of the woman.
1.8.5.3.1. Con: If a woman chooses to have an abortion, there is a consequence to the man if he wanted the child, or if he believes that abortion is immoral. In these cases, the man could be harmed by the knowledge that his own child has been aborted.
1.8.5.4. Con: Fathers are [not significantly less likely](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dispelling-the-myth-of-ge_b_1617115) than women to win custody battles, and most custody fights never make it to trial and are decided by agreement between the parties.
1.8.5.5. Con: A simpler solution to the issue of child support for unwanted children would be to allow fathers to legally relinquish all parental rights and responsibilities to a child within a certain time frame of finding out that the child exists/will exist.
1.8.6. Con: A genetic relationship to a child does not grant a person any rights that would supersede a mother's right to bodily autonomy.
1.8.6.1. Pro: If a pregnancy is the result of rape, the rapist would also have contributed half of the genetic material to the pregnancy. If the amount of genetic material contributed gives a person a right to choose, then a rapist would have as much right to that choice as the victim of his rape.
1.8.6.1.1. Con: When any individual commits and is convicted of an illegal act, they lose some of their freedoms. It stands to reason that if the father of the child were a convicted rapist, they would not legally have a right to the child.
1.8.6.2. Con: -> See 1.8.5.
1.8.6.3. Pro: If someone were to end up with an organ from an organ donor, the donor should not get to have a say about what the receiver can and can't do with that organ simply because it contains his or her genetic material.
1.8.6.4. Pro: Men do not have to face the physical or emotional burden of carrying the child to term, and so cannot have an equal say in a decision that would put a woman through that amount of stress and pain.
1.8.6.4.1. Con: Men can face serious emotional harms from the decision to bring their child into this world or abort their child, even if they aren't the ones who have to carry it to term.
1.8.6.4.1.1. Con: Minor emotional harm to one person is insufficient justification for controlling the actions of another person regarding their own bodily, psychological, emotional, and economic well-being and grossly invading their privacy to execute that control.
1.8.6.4.1.2. Pro: Abortion is a "[death experience](http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=8089)" that is more trying than most people anticipate. When men try to convince themselves that the fetus held no meaning to them, they further harm themselves by not giving themselves time to grieve.
1.8.6.4.1.3. Con: While men face emotional harms, women face both emotional and physical harms as a result of being forced to carry a child to term. Therefore we ought to weigh the harms to the woman more heavily.
1.8.6.4.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.3.1.
1.8.6.4.1.5. Pro: If a woman chooses to keep a child when the man wants her to have an abortion, then he may feel pressure to be involved in the life of a child who he did not want, and even if he is not involved he may have a hard time accepting he now has a genetic child.
1.8.6.4.2. Con: The fact that women have a vested interest in shortening the pregnancy makes them less, not more, capable of making a decision that should place the child's interest first.
1.8.6.4.2.1. Con: On the contrary, the fact that women have such a highly vested interest in the decision makes them solely qualified to make it.
1.8.6.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.4.1.
1.8.6.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.8.6.4.5. Con: -> See 1.6.3.2.2.
1.8.7. Pro: If a man has been deceived into conceiving a child by a partner, they should have a say in if the partner can have an abortion.
1.8.7.1. Con: If man has to be deceived into conceiving a child, he didn't want a child to begin with, so the pregnant individual choosing abortion would satisfy their original wants anyway.
1.8.7.2. Pro: A woman could deceive a man by lying about being on [birth control](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/a-woman-tricked-me-to-become-pregnant-and-i-am-devastated-1.3348395), in order to convince the man not to use barrier protection, and consequently become pregnant.
1.8.7.3. Con: It's virtually impossible to prove deceit, and the process of determining who is responsible to make the decision will almost certainly take too long, given that pregnancy is a rapidly developing medical condition.
1.8.7.4. Con: It is not legitimate for one person to force another to have a medical procedure they do not want. Therefore, it is unreasonable to give men this amount of control in the decision, even if they were deceived.
1.8.7.4.1. Con: It is also not legitimate for one person to force unwanted parenthood on another. Both abortions and parenthood are irreversible and carry an emotional cost, but parenthood carries life-long responsibilities and commitment, which could be considered more long-lasting and severe than an unwanted medical procedure.
1.8.7.4.2. Con: It is impossible to quantify the cost for either member in the case of deception. However if the woman deceived the man she should bear some of the cost. It goes without saying a man would get his just punishment in deceiving a woman, in terms of the lifelong emotional pain and suffering he causes.
1.9. Con: Abortions are immoral.
1.9.1. Pro: Abortions pose many concerns about the treatment of the baby while in the womb.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Even those who are pro-choice have ethical concerns about abortion.
1.9.1.1.1. Pro: 66% of those who self-identify as pro-choice, support substantial [restrictions](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/19/abortion-poll-finds-81-americans-66-pro-choice-adv/) on abortion.
1.9.1.2. Pro: Late stage abortions are particularly ethically problematic, because the baby would likely have survived if it was born immediately.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: This point concerns a very specific \(and truly unfortunate\) scenario and cannot be used to judge the validity of the original claim - that abortions are universally immoral.
1.9.1.2.1.1. Con: The above claim does not undermine the idea that all abortions are immoral and unethical. Rather, it points to a specific instance where they are particularly ethically problematic.
1.9.1.2.1.2. Pro: According to the Guttmacher Institute, [88 percent](https://www.livestrong.com/article/181997-facts-about-adoption-instead-of-abortion/) of abortions occur within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, with only 1.5 percent occurring after 21 weeks' gestation. This is mostly because late term abortions risk the life of the mother and are often done because of serious issues.
1.9.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The possibility of a woman's death associated with abortion [increases](https://www.livestrong.com/article/181997-facts-about-adoption-instead-of-abortion/) with the length of gestation. The risk of the mother's death for an abortion at between 16 and 20 weeks' gestation is one in 29,000, while the risk increases to one in 11,000 for abortions after 21 weeks.
1.9.1.2.2. Pro: There is very little difference between a late stage fetus and a newborn baby in terms of development, such that late term abortions are questionable as we would not allow people to end the life of a newborn.
1.9.1.2.2.1. Pro: By [week 33](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/pregnancy-33-to-36-weeks) a baby is fully developed even though it is still inside the womb.
1.9.1.2.3. Con: [Almost all post-viability abortions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2016/10/20/no-late-term-abortions-dont-rip-babies-out-of-wombs-but-they-are-needed/#53110d8c5cf8) are performed on women whose fetuses have died or are severely impaired such that they will not survive outside the womb.
1.9.1.2.4. Con: There are [many reasons](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/10015#.WhrwQEpl86w) why women seek late term abortions that are legitimate and should not result in the woman's choice being removed.
1.9.1.2.4.1. Pro: A lack of access to abortion clinics within a region can mean that women have arrange to travel to a clinic, which can take [significant time and resources](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7796896/)(Half of nonhospital abortion providers estimate that more than four days elapse on average between their patients' first telephone contact and the date of the procedure; one in seven say that more than one week elapses. Most women are able to obtain abortion services in one visit to a clinic. The average woman having a first-trimester nonhospital abortion with local anesthesia paid $296 for the procedure in 1993, up from $251 in 1989. On average, nonhospital facilities charged $604 at 16 weeks of gestation and $1,067 at 20 weeks.) to arrange.
1.9.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: [170,000](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/fact-check-have-more-than-170-000-irish-women-travelled-abroad-for-an-abortion-1.3481581) Irish women were forced to travel to the UK or the Netherlands to access abortion services before it was made legal in Ireland.
1.9.1.2.4.1.2. Con: It is unlikely, especially in the US, that such travel limitations would last long enough to necessitate a late term abortion.
1.9.1.2.4.2. Pro: Drastic changes to a [woman's situation](https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/influences-young-womens-decisions-about-abortion-or-motherhood)(Young women's decisions tended to depend on the economic and social context of their lives, rather than abstract moral views. Those young women who perceived their lives as insecure were more likely to view motherhood as something that might 'change their life' in a positive way. Those who were certain that their future life would develop through education and employment were more likely to opt for abortion.) could make her question her ability to raise a child, such as the death of her partner, or a large financial loss.
1.9.1.2.4.3. Con: None of the reasons that are given for having a late term abortion justify killing a living child that could survive outside the womb.
1.9.1.3. Pro: Unborn children [feel pain](https://www.doctorsonfetalpain.com/fetal-pain-the-evidence/) due to the procedure of abortion which usually consists of the fetus being removed piece by piece with forceps.
1.9.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.2.2.
1.9.1.3.2. Con: If causing someone to feel pain is immoral, then it is similarly immoral to force the mother to go through pregnancy and childbirth.
1.9.1.4. Con: Babies [feel](https://www.doctorsonfetalpain.com/fetal-pain-the-evidence/) pain at 20 weeks as that is when the nervous system is connected to the brain. [Often less than 2%](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_termination_of_pregnancy) of abortions happen after this point.
1.9.1.4.1. Pro: A [systemic review](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/201429) of the literature on the issue of fetal pain, found that fetuses only feel pain at 29 or 30 weeks.
1.9.1.4.2. Pro: Normally those abortions happen for medical reasons, including still birth.
1.9.1.4.3. Pro: In [Europe](https://www.taringa.net/+noticias/las-ley-del-aborto-en-espana-y-en-europa_12ry8o), the second highest deadline to abort is found in Sweden \(18 weeks\), only beaten by Netherlands \(24 weeks\).
1.9.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.2.
1.9.1.4.5. Con: The above claim tacitly concedes that abortions after 20 weeks are immoral \(because the fetuses involved will die painful deaths\), but appears to consider such deaths acceptable because they are relatively few. However, according to the source cited in the claim, there are still 5,578 late term abortions \(after 21 weeks\) in a single year in the USA alone.
1.9.1.5. Pro: Abortion seeks to deliberately deprive a genetically distinct human of life, without giving [due process](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/due-process-of-law) to the unborn child such as allowing the child to [confront any accuser](https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/due-process/), to attend a hearing, to be judged by a jury of peers, etc.
1.9.1.5.1. Con: This conflates "human" with "[legal person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)". Only legal persons have de facto rights to due process \(indeed, a fetus cannot even comprehend, let alone exercise such a right\).
1.9.2. Pro: Legal access to abortion means many doctors are put in the position of having to conduct an operation or aid an operation they may find deeply distressing and immoral.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Many doctors have [religious reasons](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/opinion/can-doctors-refuse-patients.html) for wanting to refuse to perform abortions.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: Those doctors shouldn't go into medical specialities where they will be expected to perform abortions.
1.9.2.2. Con: Doctors are not forced to perform non emergency abortions, since those can be done at private [clinics](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/considering-abortion/what-facts-about-abortion-do-i-need-know) \(meaning the doctor chose that path\) or with pills if soon enough.
1.9.2.3. Con: Women having the right to choose abortion does not mean that all doctors are required to perform abortions.
1.9.2.3.1. Pro: Doctors do not have to work in abortion clinics. If they feel the act is immoral, they can just not perform it.
1.9.2.3.1.1. Con: In a society in which abortion is legal, doctors who are unwilling to perform abortions risk being stigmatised. This is unfair.
1.9.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Doctors specialize by nature of their profession. There is no stigma for choosing one specialty over another. Only [14%](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2011/08/22/139859979/proportion-of-ob-gyns-offering-abortions-may-be-lower-than-thought) of OB-GYNs perform abortions.
1.9.2.3.2. Pro: OBGYN physicians can [choose](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324292) which procedures they do or do not take part in. Some OBGYN's will perform abortions, but only under certain circumstances.
1.9.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.9.2.3.1.1.
1.9.2.3.4. Pro: In a number of countries, medical professionals are allowed to [conscientiously object](https://www.bpas.org/get-involved/advocacy/briefings/conscientious-objection/) to performing abortions and the cases are passed on to other professionals.
1.9.2.3.4.1. Con: -> See discussion #2851: Conscientious objection to abortion should be banned
1.9.2.4. Con: When we choose a vocation we should consider all responsibilities of that vocation and whether or not we are willing to do the job. If we are not willing to do the job we should select a different vocation.
1.9.2.4.1. Pro: If they aren't emotionally capable of performing important procedures, they shouldn't be doctors.
1.9.2.4.2. Con: We have the right to be upset if our ideal career has what we perceive to be unnecessary moral negligence in it's responsibilities.
1.9.3. Pro: Abortion promotes selfishness and a lack of respect for life as a whole.
1.9.3.1. Con: It is categorically unselfish to not force a person into the world for whom you cannot care.
1.9.3.2. Pro: Aborting an unborn baby requires placing the mother's interests over the value of the baby's life.
1.9.3.3. Con: Abortion is [a part of nature](https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/the-bruce-effect-why-some-pregnant-monkeys-abort-when-new-males-arrive).
1.9.3.3.1. Pro: Pregnant male [pipefish](https://www.nature.com/articles/news.2010.127) abort babies from unattractive females.
1.9.3.3.1.1. Con: This is straying very far away from the parent argument. If we want to consider all odd animal behavior regarding pregnancy, there are many \(e.g. [spiders](https://entomologytoday.org/2015/03/27/arachnid-matriphagy-these-spider-mothers-literally-die-for-their-young/)\) that literally die for their offspring to have a life.
1.9.3.3.1.1.1. Con: [Maternal death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death)/death during child birth is common in humans and has only been declining in recent history.
1.9.3.3.2. Pro: The [Bruce effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_effect) \(or pregnancy block\) is a tendency in animals \(mainly rodents\) to terminate their pregnancies following exposure to the scent of an unfamiliar male.
1.9.3.3.2.1. Pro: When a new male takes over a group of [geladas](https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/the-bruce-effect-why-some-pregnant-monkeys-abort-when-new-males-arrive) in the wild, the vast majority of females terminate their [pregnancies](https://theethogram.com/2015/03/05/the-bruce-effect/).
1.9.3.3.2.2. Pro: [Bruce effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_effect) has been observed in deer-mice, meadow voles and collared lemmings.
1.9.3.3.2.3. Con: If it was natural for humans, we would have developed it ourselves. Instead, we have to rely on surgical procedures and/or drugs.
1.9.3.3.2.3.1. Con: We developed the surgical procedures and drugs ourselves.
1.9.3.3.2.4. Con: The Bruce effect doesn't have much to do with humans. Rodents and [other animals](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/140328-sloth-bear-zoo-infanticide-chimps-bonobos-animals) also eat their babies if they aren't full enough to produce nutritious milk for all of them.
1.9.3.3.3. Pro: Research suggests that pregnant female [horses](http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9440000/9440222.stm) might be able to make a subconscious decision, based on hormone levels, to terminate their pregnancy.
1.9.3.3.4. Con: Just because abortion exists in nature does not give validity to its morality within human society.
1.9.3.3.4.1. Pro: Not all natural things are good.
1.9.3.3.4.1.1. Pro: Infanticide is also part of [nature](http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9440000/9440222.stm).
1.9.3.3.4.2. Pro: To say that abortion ought to exist because it does exist is to commit the [is/ought fallacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is–ought_problem).
1.9.3.3.5. Con: The contention that abortion is ethical or good because it occurs in nature is an [appeal to nature](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature), which is a logical fallacy.
1.9.3.3.6. Con: So many strange things happen in nature regarding reproduction. Many of them no one would want to happen in human society.
1.9.3.3.6.1. Pro: Female praying mantises often [eat the male](https://gizmodo.com/why-female-praying-mantises-devour-their-partners-durin-1782818376) after mating and this helps provide more nutrients to the fetus.
1.9.3.4. Con: There is no evidence that abortion, or the legality of abortion, makes anyone more selfish or less respectful of anyone or anything.
1.9.3.4.1. Con: Abortion as well as the legality of abortion makes people less respectful of unborn babies.
1.9.3.5. Con: Selfishness would suggest that individuals engaging in abortion are gaining an immoral benefit of the procedure. This discounts the necessity of abortion due to the surrounding circumstances, such as a lack of supporting community, both familial and governmental.
1.9.3.6. Con: Imposing your will on another person, making them abide by your ideas and decisions is equally selfish and arguably more damaging. This whole argument is based on the idea that people have the right to tell women what to do, even if what they do doesn't harm you in any way.
1.9.3.6.1. Con: This is not a fair representation of the pro-life argument, which usually asserts that abortion is the intentional end of an innocent human life. Minimizing the argument to "\[telling\] women what to do" ignores the central argument of human rights and the right to life.
1.9.3.6.1.1. Con: There are more [anti-women](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/22/a-new-poll-shows-what-really-interests-pro-lifers-controlling-women) people than pro-life people in the anti-abortion movement. Therefore arguments against anti-abortion don't have to cater to the minority of pro-lifers.
1.9.3.7. Con: Selfishness is not an inherently bad thing.
1.9.3.7.1. Pro: In first aid, people are taught to take care of themselves before a patient, such as a mother putting on their [oxygen mask](https://www.smartrecovery.org/oxygen-mask-rule-for-family-friends/) in a crashing plain before they put their babies on, because it's harder to take care of someone else when something bad has happened to you.
1.9.3.7.2. Pro: Many argue that being selfish is [good](https://www.fastcompany.com/3032673/4-reasons-why-being-selfish-is-good-for-you) for people.
1.9.3.8. Pro: If children born to parents who have had previous abortions become aware of their missing siblings, they may feel like their lives are disposable and that the only reason they are alive is because they were not an inconvenience at the time they were conceived.
1.9.3.8.1. Pro: Children could experience feelings of [guilt](https://abortionsurvivors.org/the-brother-i-never-knew-abortions-impact-on-surviving-siblings/) over surviving when their sibling did not. This could be damaging to a person's psyche and would always be a factor in the trust of the parent/child relationship.
1.9.3.8.2. Con: On the contrary, the children born to the parents would know that they were wanted in the truest sense because their mother chose to carry them to term.
1.9.3.8.3. Con: If a child found out their parents wanted to abort them, weren't allowed to, and so were compelled to raise them reluctantly, that would likely cause even worse feelings of being unwanted and rejected.
1.9.3.8.4. Con: Scientific studies have shown that denying an abortion results in [negative developmental and socioeconomic consequences](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476\(18\)31297-6/fulltext) for existing children
1.9.3.9. Con: Most women \(6 of 10\) seeking abortion [already have and are taking care of other children](https://www.parents.com/parenting/i-m-a-mom-and-i-had-an-abortion/). It is an unfounded stereotype to say these women are selfish.
1.9.4. Con: Due to natural forces, human eggs are [frequently](https://www.livescience.com/43157-embryo-implant-signals-pregnancy.html) fertilized without implanting or coming to term after implanting. Attempting to procreate is considered ethical despite the fact that it frequently leads to the destruction of a fertilized egg. It therefore cannot be the case that life begins at conception in a morally relevant way.
1.9.4.1. Con: It is illogical to use "natural" causes of death as a justification for "unnatural" causes of death when the two are not the same thing. Natural causes of death are not "good" things and usually no more desirable than unnatural.
1.9.4.2. Con: The possibility of a failure in the natural process is thus not the fault of the parents, but due to an accident of nature. Consequently, nothing immoral happens in the case of death by natural forces.
1.9.5. Con: [Life](https://www.rickhanson.net/four-noble-truths-noble-truth-suffering/) is [net suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Benatar#Pain). Thus, [every birth creates more suffering](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/the-case-for-not-being-born), especially when the child is unwanted. Abortion, therefore, is a means of restricting increases in the total amount of suffering in the world, which is not immoral.
1.9.5.1. Con: It's not clear why this argument would justify abortion but not infanticide. After all, many babies will suffer a lot in their lives.
1.9.5.2. Con: If life is net suffering, you still do not have the moral righteousness to decide whether someone else's life is worth living.
1.9.5.2.1. Con: This would not be deciding the worth of someone else's life. It would merely be adhering to the mandates of morality by not forcing someone into the world.
1.9.5.2.2. Con: If life is net suffering, then the fact that it would not be worth it for a new person to exist has already been decided.
1.9.6. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.6.3.1.1.
1.9.7. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.2.2.3.
1.9.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.3.6.4.1.3.1.1.
1.9.9. Pro: Abortion might be used for eugenics.
1.9.9.1. Con: The moral value of a tool cannot be assessed based on what it might be used for. A hammer might be used for murder, but this doesn't mean we should criminalize hammers.
1.9.9.1.1. Con: However, if a tool is exceptionally dangerous, it may be possible to make a case for banning it, simply because the chance of misuse is so high.
1.9.9.1.1.1. Pro: Although this is technically a toy instead of a tool, [lawn darts](https://www.cpsc.gov/content/following-recent-injury-cpsc-reissues-warning-lawn-darts-are-banned-and-should-be-destroyed) were banned for being exceptionally dangerous.
1.9.9.1.1.2. Pro: The United Nations [banned](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/22/959583731/u-n-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons-takes-effect-without-the-u-s-and-others) nuclear weapons because of the extreme danger they pose.
1.9.9.1.1.3. Con: The likelihood of a tool to cause harm or be misused must be weighed against its usefulness.
1.9.9.1.1.3.1. Pro: [1.35 million people](https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/global-road-safety/index.html) are killed worldwide by automobiles each year but, they are such an important part of our daily lives that they can't be banned.
1.9.9.1.2. Con: Some tools/processes are only useful for immoral things. In the US, you [can't patent things that are too immoral](https://www.justia.com/intellectual-property/patents/patentability-requirements/). Rape, for example, is a process that is never justified.
1.9.9.2. Con: It cannot simply be assumed without justification that genetic selection is a bad thing.
1.9.9.2.1. Pro: [Genetic selection](https://www.genetics.org/content/183/3/757) is the cornerstone of Darwinian evolution, however it has traditionally been carried out by mate selection rather than selective birth. To suggest that there is an issue with genetic selection is to suggest that evolution itself is immoral.
1.9.9.2.2. Con: Genetic selection is by definition the application of stereotypes and would result in racism and sexism against unborn organisms.
1.9.9.3. Con: Using abortions for genetic selection can be prevented without outlawing abortion.
1.9.9.3.1. Pro: The underlying propensity for genetic selection could be culturally eradicated instead.
1.9.9.3.1.1. Pro: The [stigma](https://theirworld.org/news/breaking-down-stigma-of-children-with-disabilities) around disabilities could be eroded across society, and thus the propensity to use abortion for genetic selection could be reduced.
1.9.9.3.2. Pro: [Ohio](http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2017/12/gov_john_kasich_signs_down_syn.html) and other states have recently banned abortion after a diagnosis that the child has Down Syndrome.
1.9.9.3.3. Con: Parents can easily lie about their reasons for wanting an abortion.
1.9.9.3.3.1. Con: The law could state that pregnant people cannot learn \(non-critical\) information about the fetus until they agree to carry the pregnancy to term except in case of medical complications, thus preventing them from aborting based on genetics.
1.9.9.3.3.1.1. Con: Preventing women from knowing about the disability status of their child is inconsistent with the critical pro choice argument that she has right to make an informed decision about her body.
1.9.9.3.3.1.2. Con: An ultrasound image often makes the sex of the child obvious without a medical professional having to say anything. In such cases, it would be impossible to verify whether the decision to abort was based on the sex of the baby or not.
1.9.9.4. Con: It is not unethical to use genetic testing to prevent babies with severe disabilities from being born. It would be cruel to allow individuals whose lives would be characterised by extreme suffering to be born.
1.9.9.4.1. Con: Sometimes disabilities can be [misdiagnosed](https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-14-112) from prenatal tests. Thus, aborting children who test positive for a severe disability is unethical because some of those children may have been [misdiagnosed](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/diagnosis.html) and have had a long life ahead of them.
1.9.9.4.1.1. Con: According to this [study](https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-14-112), only 8.8% of prenatal tests are misdiagnosed, and even fewer than that for cerebral and cardiac malformations. That means, if we don't allow people to abort for severe disabilities, especially cerebral and cardiac malformations, more than nine in ten diagnosed children would be born into a life of struggle due to known severe disabilities.
1.9.9.4.1.1.1. Con: Doing something that has an 8.8% chance of unjustly killing a person is not worth the risk.
1.9.9.4.2. Pro: Women might decide to abort a fetus with a disability because they know that they do not have the capacity, time and financial resources to care for a child \(and later, an adult\) with such needs.
1.9.9.4.3. Pro: Children can be tested for the genetic disease [Tay-Sachs](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tay-sachs-disease/symptoms/), whilst they are in the womb. Children with the disease suffer terribly, losing their ability to see and hear and eventually becoming paralyzed. A woman who considers aborting a child with this condition is not acting immorally if they are preventing their child from suffering.
1.9.9.4.4. Pro: [Edwards syndrome](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/trisomy-18/) can be detected when a baby is in the womb. Those that are born with this condition suffer from several life-threatening medical problems, such as intellectual disabilities. It is not unethical for a woman to abort a child with Edwards syndrome.
1.9.9.4.5. Con: It is unethical to determine on behalf of another human being that their life is not worth keeping as it may cause them undue suffering, because suffering is subjective.
1.9.9.4.5.1. Pro: People should at least wait until the baby can decide for themselves whether their life is "suffering."
1.9.9.4.5.2. Con: There are objective facts about suffering and pain which allow us to make good predictions on what is likely to lead to suffering, and what is likely to lead to pain.
1.9.9.4.5.2.1. Pro: While some pain may be subjective, we have managed to develop painkillers and torture devices, indicating that much of it can be measured.
1.9.9.4.5.2.2. Pro: [As human brains have a great deal more in common with each other than they have differences between them](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wcs.1389), it can be reasonably assumed that, for the most part, what is pleasant for one human is useful in predicting what is pleasant for another.
1.9.9.4.6. Pro: Some [birth defects](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=90&ContentID=P02113) are fatal or severely limiting to a child. A woman deserves to choose the best life \(or kindest death\) for themselves and their child.
1.9.9.4.7. Con: Although it is hard to find statistics on the subject, the fact that many people with disabilities live without attempting suicide would seem to imply that they think that their lives are worth living.
1.9.9.4.7.1. Pro: Most disabled individuals are glad that they were given the chance to be alive, and they are glad that they were not aborted. The able bodied shouldn't make decisions about whether or not a disabled person's life is worth living without consulting the individual or the disabled community.
1.9.9.4.7.1.1. Pro: Many [disabled](https://successstory.com/inspiration/10-best-successful-personalities-with-disabilities) people have contributed to society and have lived successful lives.
1.9.9.4.7.1.1.1. Con: This does not mean that they didn't also suffer extreme hardship in their lives that they may have been better off avoiding.
1.9.9.4.7.1.1.2. Con: If parents do not have the resources to support a disabled child, they are unlikely to go on to have such successful lives.
1.9.9.4.7.1.1.3. Pro: [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking) is one of the most well-known physicists in the world, and was able to achieve that despite being diagnosed with ALS when he was 21.
1.9.9.4.7.1.1.4. Pro: [Stevie Wonder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder) is a musician, singer and songwriter who was born blind. He is considered to be one of the most critically and commercially successful musical performers of the late 20th century.
1.9.9.4.7.1.1.5. Pro: [Helen Keller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller) was an American author, political activist, lecturer and the first deaf and blind person to earn a college degree.
1.9.9.4.7.2. Con: This is only feasible in economically stable societies with resources to aid the severely disabled.
1.9.9.4.7.2.1. Pro: Life can be [incredibly difficult](https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/disability/pages/disabilityindex.aspx) for disabled people living within developing countries.
1.9.9.5. Pro: Disabled children have just as much of a right to life as any other child. In a society in which women have the right to choose an abortion, the [disabled \(p. 55\)](https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unyin/documents/children_disability_rights.pdf) will disproportionately be aborted.
1.9.9.5.1. Pro: If many disabled children are aborted, the disabled children which are born will have to live in a society with very few people like them.
1.9.9.5.1.1. Pro: Doctors and specialists will increasingly not learn about disabilities and how to approach subjects such as therapy, physical training, and education because the market for these products will disappear. This is likely to be incredibly harmful to the disabled children which are born.
1.9.9.5.1.1.1. Con: Perhaps a "market" need not exist, and [bespoke products](https://katanamrp.com/blog/bespoke-manufacturing/) could take their place.
1.9.9.5.1.2. Pro: Disabled people will increasingly lack a community of similar peers to support them.
1.9.9.5.1.2.1. Pro: Having friends with similar experiences can help contribute to people's sense of [belonging](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/parenting/the-importance-of-relationships-and-belonging-1.3405948), which in turn helps them to find their own personal meaning in life.
1.9.9.5.1.2.2. Con: By the same logic, we should prevent those that suffer from any specific ill to get better \(or at least, we shouldn't help others to avoid the ill in the first place\), because that would deprive those that keep suffering from peers to be supported by.
1.9.9.5.1.3. Pro: People in society will be very unaccustomed to disability which is likely to increase bullying and make people act in ways which are more harmful to these children.
1.9.9.5.1.3.1. Con: Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports can help prevent bullying. \([p. 325](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-a0039114.pdf)\)
1.9.9.5.1.4. Pro: If there are less disabled individuals, then there are less people who can lobby for the rights of the disabled within society.
1.9.9.5.1.5. Con: Abortion is currently legal in many countries, and there is still a reasonably sizeable disabled community, such that this does not seem to be the case.
1.9.9.5.1.5.1. Pro: Abortion has been [legal across the U.S.](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18) since 1973. [Millions](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html) of people alive in the U.S. today have a disability.
1.9.9.5.1.5.2. Pro: Abortion is available in some form in [many countries](https://reproductiverights.org/worldabortionlaws?category\[294\]=294&category\[325\]=325&category\[295\]=295&category\[296\]=296&category\[297\]=297), all of which still have many [individuals with disabilities](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/sconcerns/disability/statistics/#/countries).
1.9.9.5.1.6. Con: If a technology is developed, that would allow curing \(preventing\) certain disabilities during gestation, this same argument would go against using it. However, all other factors being equal, curing is evidently always preferable.
1.9.9.5.2. Con: Aborting a disabled child is not inherently more immoral than aborting a healthy one.
1.9.9.5.2.1. Con: Aborting an unhealthy child is not more unjust than aborting a healthy child if the reason is the same. If the mother is aborting the child because they are disabled, however, that is discriminatory.
1.9.9.5.2.1.1. Pro: One has an intuition that if the Nazis had simply spun a wheel and killed 6 million random individuals, this would not have been as bad as killing 6 million individuals because they were Jews. Crimes are worse when they are committed with the intent to harm a person based solely on their identity.
1.9.9.5.2.1.2. Pro: Intent is the determining factor in a crime. This is why [murder](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/homicide-murder-manslaughter-32637.html) is a crime even though the act is the same as killing in self defense. Simply because two people abort does not mean that these two abortions are equally morally valid.
1.9.9.5.3. Con: -> See 1.9.9.4.
1.9.9.5.4. Pro: Countries where women have the right to choose abortion, such as Norway, Denmark and [Iceland](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/new-report-iceland-aborts-100-of-babies-with-down-syndrome), are about to [eradicate Down syndrome](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/denmark-denies-practicing-eugenics-because-it-didnt-abort-4-babies-with-dow) through abortion. That is [eugenics](https://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/2013/12/deselecting-our-children-2/#.WluXxa6nGHt).
1.9.9.5.4.1. Con: The parent claim does not evidence the implicit allegation that the pregnant individuals obtained abortions specifically because the potentially resultant child might or would have Down syndrome.
1.9.9.5.4.2. Con: Women should have the right to abort babies with Down syndrome if they so choose: it is not enough to ban abortion because they might choose to have kids that will have a better quality of life.
1.9.9.5.4.3. Pro: People with Down syndrome are capable of [living happy lives, and having a job](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/downs-syndrome-parents-think-again-1032193.html). Women should not abort babies with Down syndrome because they think that their child's quality of life will be low.
1.9.9.5.4.3.1. Con: Caring for a child with Down's syndrome is exhausting and lasts even after they reach adulthood. The brunt of the effort is borne by the mother \([p. 33](http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/rups/v15n1/v15n1a03.pdf)\). Therefore she should have the right to decide if she is up to the task.
1.9.9.5.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.9.9.4.2.
1.9.9.5.5. Pro: By allowing women to choose to abort disabled babies, the state furthers the prejudiced idea that the lives of the disabled are not worth living.
1.9.9.5.5.1. Con: The state would not be providing the reason nor a compulsion to terminate pregnancies because the resulting child would be disabled. It is wholly a choice of the pregnant individual, and if the state is not prohibiting abortion in the first instance, then there is no moral condemnation imputed to the state if pregnant women determine that they want to abort disabled fetuses.
1.9.9.5.6. Con: The problem with this is that it assumes all women have the resources necessary to raise disabled children. When they do not, those children live a short life full of suffering because they cannot get the services they desperately need.
1.9.9.5.6.1. Con: Many would argue that a short life of any brevity, where the child feels love for even the briefest time, is preferable both morally and from a survival instinct point of view, than the concept of non-existence.
1.9.9.5.6.2. Pro: [Figures](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/new-scottish-statistics-show-abortion-is-a-weapon-targeted-on-the-weak-and) released by the NHS in Scotland in 2016 showed an increase in abortions where there was a risk of a baby being born disabled, as well as a disproportionate number performed on women from the most deprived areas.
1.9.9.5.6.3. Pro: The cost of raising some disabled children can be [four times](https://mom.me/kids/13673-cost-raising-child-special-needs/) the amount of a normal child.
1.9.9.5.6.3.1. Pro: Some parents do not have the money to give disabled children a comfortable life, and adoption agencies do not take many of them because families looking to adopt prefer able bodied babies. No parent should subject a child to a short and deeply painful life just because of societal biases against disabled children.
1.9.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.4.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.
