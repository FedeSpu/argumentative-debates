Pregnant people should have the right to choose abortion.";['64', '17', '9', '18', '170']
1;1.1;pro;The ability of people to access abortion services, and have control over their own reproduction, is fundamental to achieving gender equality.;['46', '4', '11', '16', '30']
2;1.0;pro;Society is better off if women only have the children they want and can raise well.;['2', '2', '1', '5', '4']
3;1.0;pro;There is evidence to suggest that the Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion in 1978 was responsible for the dramatic decrease in violent crime the United States experienced through at least 1999 (p. 414).;['0', '1', '0', '1', '1']
4;1.0;pro;Five US states legalised abortion three years before Roe v. Wade. Crime started falling three years earlier in these states, with property crime (committed by younger people) falling before violent crime.;['1', '2', '1', '1', '2']
5;1.0;pro;There is evidence from Canada, Australia, and Romania that also supports the hypothesis that abortion reduces crime.;['1', '0', '1', '1', '3']
6;1.0;con;The ends do not justify the means. Using an immoral act (abortion) to justify a good (improved crime rates) is unethical.;['1', '1', '0', '1', '0']
7;1.0;pro;Abortion can help prevent the numerous financial issues that come from having an unplanned pregnancy.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
8;1.0;pro;Many women who become pregnant are still in high school and are forced to drop out.;['1', '0', '2', '1', '0']
9;1.0;pro;When women cannot afford to raise their children they are forced to go on welfare, which is a cost to everyone.;['1', '0', '1', '1', '1']
10;1.0;pro;Women who are denied abortions and instead give birth are 3.77 times more likely to be in poverty and 6.26 times more likely to be on public assistance 6 months after denial than women who received abortions. They are also more likely to be in poverty and remain on public assistance for 4 years after denial of abortion (pp. 411-412).;['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']
11;1.0;con;A case could be made that it would be better to have our tax dollars contributed to welfare, than have that same money be contributed to abortion.;['1', '2', '0', '0', '1']
12;1.0;con;Society is best when we look out for others. Supporting people who need it through welfare is not necessarily a bad thing.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '2']
13;1.0;pro;Even if women are out of high school, unwanted pregnancy can force them to leave their jobs, furthering inequality in the workforce.;['1', '0', '1', '1', '1']
14;1.0;pro;Women often have to sacrifice their careers for childbearing and child-rearing which is not the case with men.;['0', '0', '2', '0', '0']
15;1.0;pro;Studies suggest that among men with equivalent resumes, fathers are more likely to receive call-backs and higher wage offers than are childless men.;['1', '0', '1', '1', '2']
16;1.0;pro;Pregnancy and motherhood have a substantial impact on a woman’s career.;['1', '0', '0', '2', '3']
17;1.0;pro;"Once women return to work after giving birth, many women face a ""motherhood wage penalty,” especially at the bottom of the income spectrum. This means that working mothers encounter systematic disadvantages in pay, perceived competence, and benefits relative to childless women.";['1', '0', '2', '0', '2']
18;1.0;pro;Mothers may trade higher wages for “mother-friendly” jobs that are easier to combine with parenting (p. 204).;['0', '0', '2', '0', '1']
19;1.0;pro;"The work-effort theory suggests mothers may earn less because they are less productive at work due to the needs of their children leaving them exhausted and distracted, or because they are saving their energy for their ""second shift"".";['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']
20;1.0;pro;A study at Cornell University shows that being a mother is proven to be a clear disadvantage when applying for jobs.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '0']
21;1.0;pro;When a similar experiment was reproduced in laboratory settings, mothers were offered salaries of around $11,000 less than women without children. Fathers were offered salaries of around $2,000 more. (p. 1316);['1', '0', '2', '1', '0']
22;1.0;pro;Motherhood has a greater impact on a woman’s career prospects than her level of education, according to a study by the Young Women’s Trust. Women with a dependent child are six times more likely to be economically inactive than those without children (p. 4).;['1', '0', '1', '1', '2']
23;1.0;con;This is mainly due to patriarchal oppression, not the demands of motherhood. It is possible to employ and educate mothers while giving them ample maternity leave, equal pay, and quality healthcare.;['1', '1', '2', '0', '1']
24;1.0;con;In most Western countries, there are legal measures that allow women to retain their employment status and forbid discrimination based on having children.;['2', '0', '1', '2', '2']
25;1.0;con;Taking maternity leave inherently stalls one's career, even if there is not explicit discrimination.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
26;1.0;con;A woman who gets pregnant, gives birth, and finds someone to adopt the child does not end up with a dependent child. However, having to raise a dependent child is what caused negative career outcomes for the women, not pregnancy by itself.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
27;1.0;con;It is false to suggest that future educational and career goals must be abandoned when one becomes pregnant. With the choice of adoption and the many support programs which exist today, young women or teens can postpone their educational plans but still achieve them.;['0', '1', '2', '0', '1']
28;1.0;con;This is a problem with culture and employment, not childbearing.;['3', '1', '1', '0', '1']
29;1.0;con;Preference for equality in the workforce is not a satisfactory reason for abortion.  Many childless women are treated unequally in the workforce as it is.  We can strive for equality whilst also supporting childbearing.;['1', '1', '2', '1', '1']
30;1.0;con;One of the reasons for unequal treatment of women in the workforce is the assumption that they will get pregnant and leave their job any time. If women are denied the option to terminate unwanted pregnancies, this further fuels such assumptions and encourages discrimination in the workplace.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '1']
31;1.0;pro;The option to have an abortion gives women more autonomy over their careers, as it allows them to plan ahead and discuss maternity leave with their employers before actually needing it.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']
32;1.0;con;Giving women the right to have an abortion if they want to does not oppose or contradict support for childbearing. Allowing women a choice does not make anything compulsory.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
33;1.0;con;Governments should provide support to families to ensure that abortion is not the only option and that these financial issues are not significant.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
34;1.0;pro;"Denying women the right to terminate pregnancies at an early stage implies that giving birth to children is the most important thing a woman will ever do; that her ability to give birth trumps any other contribution to society she could possibly make.";['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']
35;1.0;pro;Denying women access to safe, legal abortion in the interests of the embryo values the woman’s actual life less than the potential life of the embryo.;['1', '0', '1', '0', '4']
36;1.0;con;Denial of the right to terminate a pregnancy says nothing about the relative importance of giving birth.;['0', '1', '2', '0', '2']
37;1.0;con;Many women who have made great contributions to society have done so as mothers.;['2', '1', '3', '0', '1']
38;1.0;con;It is possible to provide more education and access to resources and contraception to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies without relying on abortion.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
39;1.0;con;Even if society is better in some ways if women only have the children they want, this is not enough to justify killing the children. Otherwise, women would be permitted kill toddlers they are currently raising but don't want.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']
40;1.0;con;Individuals contribute to society in numerous different ways, and even children that are not wanted or raised well may make valuable contributions that mean society is better off.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '1']
41;1.0;pro;If a woman is not allowed to have an abortion, she is not only forced to continue the pregnancy to birth, but also expected by society to support and look after the resulting child for many years to come.;['3', '3', '5', '5', '11']
42;1.0;pro;In certain religious households where abstinence is an important virtue, women who get pregnant out of wedlock are shunned. This leaves pregnant women with very little financial and emotional support, while forcing them to be the sole provider for the child.;['0', '0', '2', '1', '2']
43;1.0;pro;In a majority of cases, a mother is the primary caregiver of a child and has to invest more time and energy in taking care of the child.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '2']
44;1.0;pro;Many fathers leave their children behind, leaving the mothers to care for them on their own.;['2', '0', '2', '0', '0']
45;1.0;con;Father absence is a cultural problem in its own right, but no reason to preemptively abort.;['1', '1', '1', '1', '2']
46;1.0;con;What is true for the majority may not apply in every case - a father may wish to take on the role of a child's primary caregiver.;['1', '0', '4', '0', '2']
47;1.0;pro;The introduction of paternity leave in some countries has seen a rise in the number of men taking time off work to raise their children (p. 16).;['0', '0', '1', '0', '1']
48;1.0;pro;There are increasing numbers of fathers who wish to be stay at home parents.;['0', '0', '2', '0', '1']
49;1.0;con;Fathers are held financially responsible for their children. It is not only mothers who are forced to take care of the unwanted children.;['0', '0', '3', '0', '2']
50;1.0;pro;Fathers have to help fund and support the child until they are no longer a dependent, usually 18 years, which would add to the emotional burden on the father and the father's family.;['0', '0', '1', '1', '0']
51;1.0;con;Only 50% of single parents have a child support agreement in place with the other parent of their child in the US, which shows that it is difficult to enforce financial responsibility.;['0', '0', '1', '1', '0']
52;1.0;con;Abortion worsens gender inequality.;['10', '5', '2', '1', '5']
53;1.0;pro;In many countries, girls are more likely to be aborted, resulting in a disproportionate male-to-female ratio.;['0', '1', '1', '1', '3']
54;1.0;pro;When women are more likely to be aborted, this normalizes a narrative that women's lives are less important.;['0', '1', '2', '0', '1']
55;1.0;pro;In China, sons are often seen as more desirable. This is particularly the case in rural areas where sons are valued because of their ability to perform manual and agricultural work.;['0', '1', '1', '0', '0']
56;1.0;con;These narratives are being challenged and measures are being taken to prevent sex-selective abortions.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
57;1.0;pro;In India, approximately 10 million girls were aborted between 1991 and 2011, which has led to there being 914 girls to every 1000 boys by 2011.;['1', '1', '2', '0', '1']
58;1.0;pro;A study found that some Indian-born immigrants in Canada are electively aborting female fetuses if they have already had two daughters.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '1']
59;1.0;con;The incidence of this is low, and the practice is likely to go away on its own as immigrants become settled.;['0', '0', '0', '1', '0']
60;1.0;pro;A study found that in Indian families where the firstborn was a girl, the second child was unnaturally likely to be a boy, whereas if the firstborn was a boy, sex ratios among subsequent children were normal.;['0', '2', '2', '0', '3']
61;1.0;pro;The study also found that second boys were not aborted, only second girls.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
62;1.0;con;This says more about gender equality than about the right of abortion. If there is a preferred gender, then that is the issue, not the abortion.;['0', '0', '0', '1', '0']
63;1.0;con;This argument is easily separated from the larger argument by making it illegal to determine the sex of the fetus in these countries as is the case in countries like India already.;['1', '1', '1', '2', '1']
64;1.0;con;This approach undermines the freedom of couples to properly plan for their baby. There are legitimate medical and social reasons to find out the baby's sex ahead of time (e.g. preparing older siblings, intersex children, pure curiosity) that do not involve sex-based abortion. This unfairly limits all couple's options to prevent some couples from discriminatory abortions.;['0', '1', '1', '1', '1']
65;1.0;pro;Considering this topic regards whether the woman has the right to choose to terminate life, and not whether the father has any say, then support of the woman's right alone to choose is not a step for gender equality, but rather increases gender inequality.;['0', '0', '2', '0', '1']
66;1.0;pro;Abortion is an instrument of the patriarchy. It's a way men can use women as objects of sexual pleasure and escape the responsibilities of fatherhood. Sometimes women may decide to get an abortion because of pressure or threats from the father.;['0', '0', '2', '0', '0']
67;1.0;pro;A survey of 1000 women found 74% felt pressured by others while 30% chose abortion because they feared losing their man.;['0', '1', '2', '0', '2']
68;1.0;con;A survey of 1209 abortion patients found that fewer than 1% had abortions primarily because someone else insisted. Thus, in the majority of cases women would have their choice taken away by abortion being illegal, not legal.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']
69;1.0;con;Late undesired pregnancy impedes the woman of performing her professional activities for a considerable period of time, thus, making her dependent on her partner, institutions and her family.;['0', '0', '0', '2', '1']
70;1.0;con;Better access to contraception and improved sexual education would reduce the risk of unplanned pregnancies.;['1', '1', '2', '3', '2']
71;1.0;pro;Abortion is a band-aid solution to systemic issues in society. While it may need to remain legal, it does nothing to address the reasons behind unwanted pregnancy.;['2', '1', '1', '0', '2']
72;1.0;con;The issue is that these resources are not properly allocated or presented to the populace. Women should not be made to suffer because of a failure of government.;['0', '1', '0', '1', '2']
73;1.0;pro;In many countries without strong state support for family planning services, doctors might be more inclined towards the lucrative work of performing abortions over the prescription of birth control - as was the case in Romania throughout the 1990s.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '0']
74;1.0;con;"The possibility of doctors being corrupt and state not having strong family planning services support are not variables that should come into play when deciding general legality of abortion. They circumvent the fundamental ""right to abortion"" issue by blaming external factors.";['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
75;1.0;con;Abortion would not disappear no matter how accessible birth control and adoption becomes.;['0', '0', '2', '0', '2']
76;1.0;pro;Sweden's abortion statistics show that abortions will still happen, even in spite of the fact that many parts of the country provide heavily subsidised birth control for women up to their mid-twenties, free condoms at clinics, and free abortions up to 25-26.;['0', '0', '1', '1', '0']
77;1.0;con;Access to contraception will not help when many religious and cultural circles demand abstinence. Young women may have access to contraception but choose not to carry or use it because they are at a higher risk of being caught and punished for being sexually active.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '3']
78;1.0;con;A lot of those circles also ban abortion, so the justification of abortion by citing these situations is a fallacy. They already stigmatise abortion and demand carrying to full term, so they are an irrelevant factor in the discussion.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
79;1.2;pro;There are many reasons a woman may not be equipped to or want to raise a child. In these cases, it is important that she is able to choose abortion.;['24', '11', '10', '22', '39']
80;1.0;pro;Bringing a child into the world has consequences not only restricted to the moment of birth but for the rest of the mother's life and for all the people around them.;['5', '2', '7', '4', '6']
81;1.0;pro;Many households experience a significant decline in economic well-being in the time around a birth. They face increased demands on resources, changes in the composition of income, and a potentially heightened risk of economic insecurity.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
82;1.0;pro;The drop in parents’ income around childbirth can have major consequences for children as well. Inadequate family income is harmful for children—particularly young children—affecting their long-term social-emotional, cognitive, and academic outcomes (p. 15).;['1', '0', '1', '1', '1']
83;1.0;con;Pregnancy and the growth in household size may trigger an increase in public program eligibility and benefit levels among economically disadvantaged households.;['2', '0', '1', '1', '1']
84;1.0;pro;Many major cash and near-cash safety net programs in USA including the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC), either restrict eligibility to households with children, or increase benefit levels when a new child is added to the assistance unit.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
85;1.0;pro;The Special Supplemental Nutritional Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) is a federal assistance program that provides near-cash nutritional assistance targeted at this time period. It targets low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and children under the age of five.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
86;1.0;con;Even in most of the developed countries, the social assistance that new mothers are entitled to is rarely sufficient on its own, especially if the mother was forced to give up her job to care for the child.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
87;1.0;pro;In the UK, a single parent with two children could expect £292 a month. The person must have no income or low income, work less than 16 hours a week, and have savings of under £16,000.;['0', '0', '2', '0', '0']
88;1.0;pro;In France a single parent with two children would be eligible for as much as €1,068.61 each month, but that benefit would be lessened by any actual income or other cash benefits the person was claiming.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '0']
89;1.0;pro;A single person with one child in Ontario, Canada would receive a benefit of just less than $1,000 Canadian dollars a month, with no lifetime limit.;['0', '0', '2', '0', '0']
90;1.0;pro;The amount an average single parent with two children receives in the US is set by each state, with a 60 month lifetime limit. In Mississippi, they would receive $153 a month. In Alaska, the average benefit was $642 a month.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '0']
91;1.0;pro;Parenthood can have a negative impact on a marriage. The relationship between spouses may suffer once children come along.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
92;1.0;pro;Parenthood hastens marital decline - even among relatively satisfied couples who select themselves into this transition. The rate of the decline in relationship satisfaction is nearly twice as steep for couples who have children than for childless couples.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '0']
93;1.0;pro;In the event that a pregnancy is unplanned, the parents experience even greater negative impacts on their relationship, including increase in relationship conflict and a decrease in love.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '0']
94;1.0;con;Abortion can also have a negative impact on marriage and relationship.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']
95;1.0;pro;There is an increased risk for separation or divorce following an abortion (p. 2).;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
96;1.0;pro;A study by Rue and colleagues reported that out of 331 Russian and 217 American women, 6.8% of Russian women and 26.7% of American women indicated relationship problems caused by an abortion experience. 7.8% of Russian women and 19.8% of American women indicated that their relationships had ended as a direct consequence of the abortion.;['0', '0', '2', '0', '1']
97;1.0;pro;Associations between abortion and relationship conflict are logical since anger is a common post-abortion emotional response.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
98;1.0;con;If the pregnant individual obtains an abortion, the other party likely either agreed to it, in which case they affirmatively assented to the risk of negative impact, or the relationship was already on rocky foundations such that obtaining the abortion could not have significant causal effect on its health.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
99;1.0;pro;If the pregnant individual did not seek the consent of the other person, they probably have a reason for doing so that suggests the relationship's foundations are not solid.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
100;1.0;pro;6 out of 10 people who get abortions already have children, and many feel they need to dedicate their time and resources to the children they already have, rather than having another.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']
101;1.0;pro;A study by University of California shows that existing children of women denied an abortion have 4 percentage point lower scores across all six domains of child development.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '0']
102;1.0;con;Abortion can have a negative effect on living children.;['1', '2', '0', '0', '1']
103;1.0;pro;Post-abortal women report that their ability to respond to the remaining or future child(ren) can be manifested in several ways: a feeling of emotional numbness which leads to a lack of bonding, acting out of hostility and anger which can result in child abuse, and considering future children as “replacement children” who become overindulged (p. 11).;['0', '2', '0', '0', '1']
104;1.0;pro;After abortion, “replacement” children may find themselves the object of obsessive parenting styles of post-abortal parents who focus inordinate time, affection, or material goods on them. Parents may attempt to replace the lost child with a “wanted” child soon after the abortion. This can be detrimental to a child's development and behavior (p. 13).;['0', '1', '1', '0', '1']
105;1.0;con;A child also can have a negative impact on a mothers life, but this doesn't mean that is a legitimate reason to kill the child.;['0', '1', '1', '0', '2']
106;1.0;con;It can not be said that ending the life of a living child, is equivalent to ending the life of an unborn child. The living child and the unborn child have very different sets of capacities (self awareness, ability and conceptualize pain, ability to form social ties etc.).;['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']
107;1.0;pro;Pregnancy and parenthood are very expensive and time consuming. Many women who get abortions are already mothers, and they want to provide the best care they can to their existing children, financially, emotionally, and physically. This should be their choice.;['3', '2', '4', '2', '10']
108;1.0;con;If the fetus is already a child, then it follows from your argument that one should be able to terminate one's offspring to better provide for the rest. This is immoral, and therefore, abortion for the reasons you presented is immoral.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']
109;1.0;con;A vasectomy or tubal ligation would be adequate and less harmful in this scenario.;['0', '1', '1', '1', '1']
110;1.0;con;Some hospitals do not perform vasectomies or tubal ligations on religious grounds.

116;1.0;pro;Men are equally responsible for pregnancy but are often unwilling to fulfil their paternal role. When this occurs, an unplanned pregnancy can lead to socio-economic hardship for mother and child.;['1', '0', '2', '1', '1']

119;1.0;pro;Individuals have more choice and freedom today, which allows people to improve their conditions more easily than those in the past.;['0', '0', '2', '0', '0']
120;1.0;con;Demographics have changed. Even though birthrate was high at that time, death rate of children was also very high. Therefore a lot of them were not raised, they died before maturity. On the contrary, today, it's no longer necessary to have a lot of children to ensure descendants.;['0', '1', '1', '0', '0']
121;1.0;con;One of the reasons families were bigger in past centuries was because children could provide for the household at a much younger age and without having most of the qualifications that are necessary now. Nowadays having a child implies supporting them until they finish a degree and even that is no guarantee of success. The world simply does not work that way anymore.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '0']
122;1.0;con;Supporting them until they finish a degree is an exaggeration. There are no age restrictions on certain types of jobs in the U.S. At 14, they can work limited hours at any non hazardous job. At 16, unlimited hours at any non-hazardous job. At 18, unlimited at any job. If they choose college, there are grants or loans that can pay their way if the parents can't.;['0', '1', '1', '0', '1']
123;1.0;con;This is an argument for the state providing more support for mothers rather than for allowing abortion.;['1', '0', '3', '0', '2']
124;1.0;pro;The money spent on providing free or reduced cost abortion services can be spent on publicly funded aid for mothers and/or the children that were born as a result of an unwanted pregnancy.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']
125;1.0;pro;Many countries do provide child benefits which can help parents with the financial costs of raising a child.;['0', '0', '1', '1', '1']
126;1.0;con;Arguing that the government should provide more support for new parents doesn't resolve the question of what decisions a pregnant person should make (or be allowed to) in the conditions they are currently experiencing. Even if there were more supports for parents that doesn't justify coercing them to gestate to term.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']

394;1.0;pro;There are many reasons why utilitarianism may be flawed.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
395;1.0;con;Utilitarian evaluations are relevant to many people, particularly utilitarians, whether they are the sole basis for every person's opinion or not.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
396;1.0;con;"Having an abortion for medical reasons makes up less than 1% of all abortions, even lower when the ""life of the mother"" is in jeopardy. The utilitarian justification for abortion is therefore very, very small.";['0', '1', '1', '0', '1']

398;1.0;pro;Statistics regarding the number of abortions due to endangerment of mother's life back this up. Florida, 2015: 0.065%. UK,1968-2011: 0.006%. U.S. estimate: 1%.;['2', '1', '1', '0', '4']
399;1.0;con;The number of times something happens doesn't always make it less important. If you, or someone else you care about, were in that 1%, you would likely want them to be able to access to abortion.;['1', '1', '1', '1', '2']
400;1.0;con;Abortion would still need to be legal for those cases, as adoption would not solve the issue at hand.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
401;1.0;con;"""Less than 1% of all abortions"" could be misleading because if between 1970 and 2014, there were ""44.5 million legal induced abortions"", then there could be 445k abortions that fall in this category. That would be a significant impact to a lot of people.";['1', '1', '1', '0', '5']
402;1.0;con;Many argue that morality is not subjective when it comes to causing harm. If abortion causes harm to the fetus then the context does not matter.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']
403;1.0;pro;Morals are a set of rules that individuals live by, thus it cannot be suggested that people with different morals are somehow incorrect or wrong.

404;1.0;con;Saying that “women should always have the right to choose” is a moral judgment, that according to your argument, can not be judged as “correct” or “right.” All laws are codifications of moral judgments, and there are some acts that are universally considered immoral, such as the taking of an innocent human life.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']

413;1.0;con;"Morality by definition is not subjective. Preferences are entirely subjective and are neither right or wrong, they are just different tastes.

428;1.0;con;A fetus develops during the gestational period such that it does gain self-awareness and consciousness. Therefore it can still be argued it should qualify for personhood status while still in utero.;['1', '2', '2', '0', '1']
429;1.0;pro;A fetus develops the capacity for self-awareness and consciousness around the beginning of the second trimester. Thus, it should be regarded as having the unalienable right to life.;['0', '1', '1', '0', '2']
430;1.0;con;While it is true that a fetus develops sentience in utero, it does not have sentience from the moment of conception.

433;1.0;con;It's very clear why cognitive capacities are sufficient for a fetus and not sufficient for an animal. A fetus is a human and an animal is not. Human rights are not the same as animal rights.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']

436;1.0;pro;The right to life is fundamental, but life begins at independent viability.;['1', '1', '1', '1', '1']
437;1.0;pro;A fetus's right to life does not imply the right to use the mother's body to sustain its life.;['1', '1', '0', '2', '2']
438;1.0;pro;In Judith Jarvis Thomson's famous violinist example, she argues that people would be outraged if upon waking up they found themselves plugged to an ailing violinist and told that in order for the violinist to remain alive, they must remain plugged to them for the next nine months.;['2', '1', '1', '1', '4']
439;1.0;pro;Such an experiment demonstrates how abortion does not violate a fetus' right to life. Rather, it just deprives the fetus of the use of the pregnant person's body.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
440;1.0;con;In the violinist example the violinist is a complete stranger, while in a pregnancy the baby is the mother's own child.;['1', '1', '0', '0', '0']
441;1.0;pro;A mother who fails to provide for her own child's basic needs such as food and water is guilty of child neglect, whereas someone who passes a stranger on the street begging for food and doesn't give them anything is not guilty of a crime. This intuitively supports the idea that a person's obligations towards their own child is greater than that towards a stranger.;['0', '0', '0', '1', '0']
442;1.0;con;One plausibly has duties (moral or legal) to persons under one's charge, like children. However, it is not at all clear that one has duties to an unwanted fetus.;['0', '0', '1', '1', '0']
443;1.0;con;"A mother has duties to her two-year-old son, regardless of whether the child is ""wanted"". Therefore it is plausible that the fetus being ""unwanted"" doesn't take away her duties towards it.";['0', '0', '0', '2', '0']
444;1.0;con;The violinist example can only be used to justify abortion in the case of rape, because in the example, you did nothing that could have led to you being attached to the violinist.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']
445;1.0;con;The violinist example is not analogous because withdrawing support is very different from directly killing. In that example, the person did not create the violinist's dependency on their body whereas the parents are responsible for the creation of a fetus, thereby creating an obligation to provide due care.;['1', '1', '1', '1', '3']
446;1.0;con;It is an assumption that all biological parents choose to create life and so accrue obligations to the fetus. In cases where parent do not deliberately concieve, the violinist is equivalent to a fetus and so the thought experiment holds true.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '0']
447;1.0;con;This assumes that withdrawing support is different from direct killing. This distinction is unclear at best, since both cases involve a decision (terminate life) causally connected to a consequence (termination of life).;['1', '0', '2', '1', '0']
448;1.0;pro;When a fetus is able to exist independently from the mother's body they can be considered to be independent living beings.

450;1.0;con;Viability is a weak argument for determining the right to life. A human on life-support isn't viable, but we still believe they are are human beings with rights.;['2', '1', '1', '2', '3']
451;1.0;pro;Newborns (and most people who are under 18) cannot live independently, but they are still persons.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']

460;1.0;con;A sperm plus an egg would give rise to such a totipotent cell. If such a cell is of moral value, it stands to reason that what gives rise to it is also of moral value.

1056;1.0;con;It is unethical to determine on behalf of another human being that their life is not worth keeping as it may cause them undue suffering, because suffering is subjective.;['0', '2', '2', '0', '2']

1061;1.0;con;It cannot simply be assumed without justification that genetic selection is a bad thing.;['0', '3', '4', '3', '11']
1062;1.0;pro;Genetic selection is the cornerstone of Darwinian evolution, however it has traditionally been carried out by mate selection rather than selective birth. To suggest that there is an issue with genetic selection is to suggest that evolution itself is immoral.;['1', '2', '1', '1', '2']
1063;1.0;con;Genetic selection is by definition the application of stereotypes and would result in racism and sexism against unborn organisms.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '1']
1064;1.0;con;Using abortions for genetic selection can be prevented without outlawing abortion.;['2', '1', '5', '4', '14']

1069;1.0;con;The law could state that pregnant people cannot learn (non-critical) information about the fetus until they agree to carry the pregnancy to term except in case of medical complications, thus preventing them from aborting based on genetics.;['1', '1', '2', '0', '0']
1070;1.0;con;Preventing women from knowing about the disability status of their child is inconsistent with the critical pro choice argument that she has right to make an informed decision about her body.;['0', '1', '1', '0', '2']
1071;1.0;con;An ultrasound image often makes the sex of the child obvious without a medical professional having to say anything. In such cases, it would be impossible to verify whether the decision to abort was based on the sex of the baby or not.;['0', '1', '1', '0', '2']
1072;1.0;con;The moral value of a tool cannot be assessed based on what it might be used for. A hammer might be used for murder, but this doesn't mean we should criminalize hammers.;['0', '0', '0', '2', '3']
1073;1.0;con;However, if a tool is exceptionally dangerous, it may be possible to make a case for banning it, simply because the chance of misuse is so high.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '2']

1078;1.0;con;Some tools/processes are only useful for immoral things. In the US, you can't patent things that are too immoral. Rape, for example, is a process that is never justified.;['1', '0', '1', '0', '0']
1079;1.0;con;Life is net suffering. Thus, every birth creates more suffering, especially when the child is unwanted. Abortion, therefore, is a means of restricting increases in the total amount of suffering in the world, which is not immoral.;['9', '1', '3', '3', '5']
1080;1.0;con;It's not clear why this argument would justify abortion but not infanticide. After all, many babies will suffer a lot in their lives.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '1']
1081;1.0;con;If life is net suffering, you still do not have the moral righteousness to decide whether someone else's life is worth living.;['1', '1', '1', '0', '2']
1082;1.0;con;If life is net suffering, then the fact that it would not be worth it for a new person to exist has already been decided.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']
1083;1.0;con;This would not be deciding the worth of someone else's life. It would merely be adhering to the mandates of morality by not forcing someone into the world.;['1', '0', '2', '0', '1']
1084;1.0;con;Due to natural forces, human eggs are frequently fertilized without implanting or coming to term after implanting. Attempting to procreate is considered ethical despite the fact that it frequently leads to the destruction of a fertilized egg. It therefore cannot be the case that life begins at conception in a morally relevant way.;['0', '0', '1', '2', '0']
1085;1.0;con;The possibility of a failure in the natural process is thus not the fault of the parents, but due to an accident of nature. Consequently, nothing immoral happens in the case of death by natural forces.;['1', '1', '2', '0', '1']
1086;1.0;con;"It is illogical to use ""natural"" causes of death as a justification for ""unnatural"" causes of death when the two are not the same thing. Natural causes of death are not ""good"" things and usually no more desirable than unnatural.";['1', '1', '2', '0', '1']
