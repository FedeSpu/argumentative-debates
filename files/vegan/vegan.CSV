9;1.1.1.1.5;con;If cruelty and suffering are concerns, then acquiring meat from a hunter (or similar instant killing method) should be acceptable. In other words, you do not have to go vegan to avoid animal suffering - you just must be certain that your source of meat is cruelty-free.;['0', '0', '1', '1', '0']; ;4
10;1.1.1.1.5.1;con;Killing an animal is not cruelty-free. The cruelty of killing extends to their family if they are part of raising it, as well as dying by having a short life and another being deciding their fate in life for them. Veganism does not create these abuses.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;5

13;1.1.1.1.6.2;con;The reduction in quality of the product is offset by an increase in quantity produced, resulting in a net increase in revenue.

31;1.1.1.1.7.2.3.6;con;Many chickens have been bred to produce more eggs than is healthy for them to do so. Their calcium can become severely depleted, and it is difficult to feed them enough to overcome this.;['1', '0', '0', '1', '1']; ;7

36;1.1.1.1.7.2.6;con;The majority of consumers prioritize the cost and ease of meat rather than the ethics of production. Just because a minority choose to carefully select their produce, does not compensate for a majority who do not.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']; 3;6

38;1.1.1.1.7.4;con;Free range chickens are still slaughtered, selectively bred for rapid growth to a point where for some, their legs can't support them, and kept in overcrowded barns. Free Range doesn't equal a happy life for the animal.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '1']; 1;5

52;1.1.1.2.2.2.2.1;pro;Consciousness is a barely understood concept, even in humans, but this does not mean there is no consciousness. Humans act on the assumption consciousness exists for themselves and others.;['0', '2', '0', '0', '0']; ;7
53;1.1.1.2.2.2.2.1.1;con;Humans assume what we interpret from data and evidence. We cannot suppose animals are conscious if they don't show any evidence of it. So we shouldn't act on it until we know for sure.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;8
54;1.1.1.2.2.2.2.2;pro;When we compare the human reactions signalling pain to reactions often expressed by animals when they possibly would feel pain, they are very similar.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 4;7
55;1.1.1.2.2.2.2.3;con;We can also assume that farmed animals have no concept of life outside the farm, and since they've never experienced anything but farm life, they would have no reason not to be happy with life on the farm.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '1']; ;7

58;1.1.1.2.2.4;pro;Differential treatment of whether killing of someone or something for food is admissible must be based on some trait the subject is lacking.

59;1.1.1.2.2.5;con;Animals do not have similar levels of emotional comprehension or intelligence (1, 2) to humans. Therefore they are of less value.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 25;5

62;1.1.1.2.2.5.2;con;There are difficulties in measuring emotional and general intelligence. To base a life's value on subjective ranking does not make sense.;['0', '0', '0', '1', '0']; ;6
63;1.1.1.2.2.5.2.1;pro;Humans possess few unique abilities or skills and are worse than animals in some respects. This does not make humans less valuable, and the same criteria should be applied to animals.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 4;7
64;1.1.1.2.2.5.2.2;pro;Animals react to stimuli differently, but still emotionally. Because they react differently, humans do not take it seriously or say their responses even exist or have merit. That is why people do not believe animals are intelligent or smart.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 2;7
65;1.1.1.2.2.6;con;Many animals do not pass the mirror test as a measure of self awareness.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;5

67;1.1.1.2.2.7;con;Since animals do not possess free will in the same way as humans, they can't have any rights (p. 538).;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 39;5
68;1.1.1.2.2.7.1;con;Animals may not have positive rights due to an inability to meaningfully have duties, but they could still have negative rights, for which free will is not necessary.;['0', '1', '0', '0', '0']; 2;6
69;1.1.1.2.2.7.2;con;Infants don't know about or obey any laws, and yet have rights: harming or killing infants is against the law. Animals have or may be given rights in the same way.;['1', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;6

72;1.1.1.2.3.4;con;If one is concerned with numbers of deaths of living organisms, then this argument is actually in support of voluntary suicide via starvation, as many plants must be killed or aborted to support the life of one human being.;['3', '0', '1', '0', '0']; 10;5
73;1.1.1.2.3.4.1;con;When considering morality, it is necessary to draw a line. It is unlikely that most humans would adopt a moral position that requires them to starve themselves to death, therefore it is necessary to strike a balance between surviving and acting ethically.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']; ;6

76;1.1.1.2.4.1.1;pro;Veganism is based on the false superiority of animals against plants, while we already know about plant life (like Pando) that is much more complex than sponges (animals).

77;1.1.1.2.4.1.1.1;con;Appeal to extremes / reductio ad absurdum. Vegans do not have to argue that sponges are superior and sacred compared to some plants. The general superiority of animals is not false - some animals that we eat are conscious, sentient beings. No plants are conscious or sentient.;['1', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 1;7

104;1.1.1.2.4.2.3;con;Veganism is anthropocentric in that it believes in a hierarchy of sentience, with humans at the top and plants at the bottom.
