77;1.1.4.3.1.1.2.3.2.2.1;con;Draco Malfoy was only injured because he was too arrogant to listen to Hagrid's instructions. This is largely Malfoy's fault and not Hagrid's, as Harry Potter was able to interact with the Hippogriff without being harmed.;['0', '0', '7', '4', '0']; ;10
78;1.1.4.3.1.1.2.3.2.2.1.1;con;Draco Malfoy was thirteen years old at the time. Thirteen-year-olds should not be put in situations where they could be maimed if they don't follow instructions correctly.;['0', '2', '5', '3', '1']; ;11

84;1.1.4.3.1.1.2.6.1.1;con;The use of the black quill would have been illegal given that corporal punishment is not a generally accepted practice at Hogwarts and Harry was repeatedly advised to report Professor Umbridge's actions to Professor McGonagall.;['0', '0', '4', '7', '1']; ;9
85;1.1.4.3.1.1.2.7;pro;It was irresponsible for Dumbledore to appoint Remus Lupin, a known werewolf, as a teacher without letting the students or their parents know about his condition.;['0', '6', '5', '1', '0']; 4;7
86;1.1.4.3.1.1.2.7.1;con;If Dumbledore had followed this process, Lupin would never have been given the job due to unreasonable prejudices of the wizarding population. This would be unjust for a man of Lupin's ability.;['0', '1', '4', '7', '0']; ;8
87;1.1.4.3.1.1.2.7.1.1;con;The stigma against werewolves is regrettable but a school full of children is not the best place to hire one in the first place.;['0', '5', '7', '0', '0']; ;9
88;1.1.4.3.1.1.2.7.1.1.1;con;The sequence of events which led to Lupin not taking his potion was unlikely and impossible to predict. Dumbledore had good reason to assume Lupin would take his potion without concern.;['0', '2', '3', '6', '0']; 2;10
89;1.1.4.3.1.1.2.7.1.1.1.1;con;Dumbledore knew better than anyone the relationship Lupin and Sirius shared since their childhood, and that Sirius wanted to come to Hogwarts to speak with Harry Potter.;['0', '8', '3', '0', '0']; 1;11

93;1.1.4.3.1.1.2.7.2.1;con;Parents and students do have a right to information that might directly undermine the health and safety of students on campus.

94;1.1.4.3.1.1.2.8;pro;Teachers are very biased in the way they award house points: some such as Snape tend to favour their own house and punish the others.;['0', '2', '7', '3', '0']; 3;7
95;1.1.4.3.1.1.2.8.1;pro;Dumbledore awarded enough points to Gryffindor to make them win the House Cup instead of Slytherin even though the term had officially ended. On the other hand, McGonagall did not take away any points from Harry and Ron after they crashed the flying car into the Whomping Willow, since the term had not yet started.;['0', '0', '4', '8', '0']; ;8
96;1.1.4.3.1.1.2.8.2;pro;This is particularly true as most teachers went through Hogwarts themselves and thus have a natural bias toward the house they were in.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;8

116;1.1.4.3.1.1.4.1.1.2.1;pro;The parties involved usually agree to limits on spells to be used during the duel. This indicates that duelists generally agree not to use particularly dangerous or illegal spells, such as the Unforgivable Curses.;['0', '0', '3', '9', '0']; ;10
