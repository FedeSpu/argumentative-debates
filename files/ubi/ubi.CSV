0;1;None;Wealthy countries should provide citizens with a universal basic income (UBI).;['0', '30', '47', '111', '265'];;0
1;1.1;pro;A UBI is the most effective and efficient wealth redistribution system.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 7;1
2;1.1.1;pro;The reliability of a UBI, relative to other forms of welfare, allows the poor the ability to better plan and budget their spending.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 2;2
3;1.1.1.1;pro;The UBI can be spent in productive ways (e.g. investing into a business) that traditional welfare cannot. This creates social mobility.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;3
4;1.1.2;pro;A UBI helps reduce governmental, bureaucratic, and regulatory burdens.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 8;2
5;1.1.2.1;pro;UBI reduce administrative control on citizen life, by making help unconditional, hence removing administrative power through arbitrary decisions;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 4;3
6;1.1.2.2;pro;A process applied to many people equally is a lot simpler than many independent agencies and laws coming into play for fewer people.;['0', '0', '0', '11', '8']; ;3
7;1.1.2.2.1;pro;A UBI is cheaper to administer than existing welfare systems and thus frees would-be bureaucrats to contribute to the economy and thus wastes less money.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 4;4
8;1.1.2.2.2;pro;A UBI is simpler to administer and is therefore less prone to denying deserving people coverage because of bureaucratic inefficiencies (delays, miscategorisation of people, and other barriers to access).;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 2;4
9;1.1.2.2.2.1;pro;Means-tested benefits often exclude many who are in need of support. Since a UBI is universal, those who need the money most would receive it.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;5
10;1.1.2.2.2.2;pro;"Many people are unaware of the fact that they are eligible for government programs; for example the US has more than $300 million in unclaimed pension benefits. This lack of information often prevents them from accessing their entitlements.";['0', '0', '0', '0', '1']; 2;5
11;1.1.2.2.2.3;pro;With a one-size-fits all income transfer there is less need for governments to waste resources tracking down issues such as welfare fraud or when people cross into higher income thresholds.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;5
12;1.1.2.2.2.3.1;con;A UBI is subject to fraud.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 10;6
13;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.1;pro;UBI replaces many social welfare programs with central administration. This process streamlines transfer payments, it also creates an slush fund for demagogues. A diffuse & complicated system is difficult to suborn. A centralized source of patronage payments creates an irresistible and attainable slush fund for machine-politicians.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 3;7
14;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.2;pro;Fraudulent use could include people creating false documentation in order to get paid more than once.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;7
15;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.2.1;con;In order to avoid overspending on fraudulent persons, there is an incentive to monitor for fraud more carefully.;['1', '2', '0', '2', '2']; ;8
16;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.2.1.1;con;An incentive to monitor for fraud more carefully means a need for more bureaucracy, which is contrary to the claim that a UBI would reduce bureaucracy.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 8;9

18;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.2.2.1;pro;The incentives for identity theft/fraud are already strong in developed economies. It is unclear that extracting traceable regular, relatively small UBI payments will be more attractive than e.g untraceable one-off, high value credit card fraud.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;9
19;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.3;pro;In the US, federal agencies are often sloppy in their administration of programs, and Congress provides little serious oversight.;['8', '20', '8', '2', '3']; 7;7
20;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.3.1;con;A UBI is much easier to administer than other welfare programs — all it requires is that the government send a check. This has little margin for error or exploitation.;['0', '2', '4', '9', '4']; ;8
21;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.3.2;con;By the same argument, the military has documented waste in the billions, year after year. Yet it is tolerated in the name of the greater good.;['0', '0', '0', '1', '2']; ;8
22;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.3.2.1;con;This claim aides that the central government presiding over the military will have difficulties preventing UBI fraud if the same government wastes billions on other programs.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '1']; 1;9
23;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.3.2.2;con;"It is not well tolerated by some; there are plentiful criticisms of the American military, both inside and outside America.";['0', '0', '1', '1', '0']; ;9
24;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.3.3;con;Then the argument should be towards an improvement of program implementation, not the elimination of programs that benefit the people.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;8
25;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.3.3.1;con;"This discussion is about a UBI; however, and in the US, a UBI doesn't yet exist. So no elimination of programs is being considered. At this point it's more of a matter of the US shouldn't implement this program within a broken system.";['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;9
26;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.3.4;con;This is a systemic issue of congress and federal agencies, and shouldn't relate to UBI specifically. This is an issue which should be addressed regardless of subject matter.;['0', '0', '2', '3', '0']; ;8
27;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.3.4.1;con;If we accept that congress is sloppy, etc. then to say that we should implement this policy without first fixing said issue seems ill advised.;['0', '0', '0', '1', '0']; ;9
28;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.3.4.1.1;con;Using this argument we should stop building schools because some construction companies are corrupt.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;10
29;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.3.4.2;con;We are discussing UBI specifically. The systemic issue existing does not detract from its affects on UBI and fraud.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;9
30;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.3.5;con;This is just as much an argument for no UBI as it is for a UBI. If there was UBI in the US it would be administered by the same flawed and inefficient system as current programs, which means that the same challenges would persist.;['0', '1', '1', '1', '1']; 6;8

32;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1;con;A UBI encourages more people to have children, solving the low birth rate problem that exists in many Western countries.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '2']; 16;8
33;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1;pro;The lack of financial resources is an important reason why many individuals hold off on having children. A UBI mitigate this issue and helps the affected individuals to fulfil their desire to have children.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 4;9
34;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1.1;pro;In the USA child-care costs account for at least 30% of a minimum-wage worker’s earnings. In New York and Massachusetts the cost rises to as much as 80%.;['0', '0', '7', '7', '0']; ;10
35;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1.2;pro;Surveys have shown that European women want to have two or more children (2.36 on average). While countries in north-west Europe approach that number, in southern Europe they do not. Government action in the former, through child benefits, tax breaks, maternity leave or nursery provisions, may be a key factor.;['0', '0', '10', '0', '0']; ;10
36;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1.3;pro;The average child in the U.S. represents an investment of $304,500 from the moment of birth to the child's 18th birthday. This is a significant amount.;['0', '2', '9', '4', '0']; ;10
37;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1.4;con;That claim is very much contrary to the evidence of the people that have more children are generally low income.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 1;10
38;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1.5;con;UBI contributes to the planet's biggest future problem, that of over-population. By removing the responsibility of being able to afford having children, it will lead to a vicious downward spiral of starvation and violence as more people compete for less and less life-sustaining resources such as food and water.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 6;10
39;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1.5.1;con;Over population should be considered a serious problem but using financial positions to keep people from reproducing is perhaps an irresponsible approach. If we need to be careful with our population then that issue should be addressed directly and honestly and people should be informed of it rather than relying on an unrelated aspect of society to steer some people away.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;11
40;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1.5.2;con;Overpopulation is now being shown to be anon-issue, people are very aware of it and have reacted without being prompted. There have been fewer births recently than in a long time.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 2;11
41;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1.6;con;It may not be a good idea for people who do not have moneymaking know-how or a sense of responsibility to raise children who would grow up to have similar traits.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;10
42;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.1.6.1;con;"In a society under UBI, ""responsibility"" would become far more diverse than simply ""providing for yourself"" and ""not living beyond your means"".";['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;11
43;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.2;con;The World population (and US population) are climbing rapidly. China, India and Sub-Saharan Africa are currently overpopulated, requiring significant food imports to sustain the population.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 2;9

46;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.4;con;The birth rate isn't too bad. This assumes that finances are the main reason people don't have more kids.;['0', '0', '3', '0', '0']; ;9
47;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.5;con;There is no reason to assume low birth rates would be a problem.;['0', '0', '2', '1', '2']; ;9

49;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.5.2;con;A low birth rate in one area or cultural segment will lead that segment to disappear in the long term, hence being taken over by other ways of thinking or living.;['0', '1', '0', '0', '0']; 8;10

51;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.5.2.1.1;pro;Many cultural segments have disappeared along human history and it is hard to quantify whether this fact was detrimental to humanity as a whole in terms other than intuition.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;12
52;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.5.2.1.2;pro;The existence of certain cultural segments is not objectively good or bad for the society, therefore it is hard to argue with certainty that their disappearance will be bad.;['0', '0', '1', '0', '0']; ;12
53;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.5.2.1.3;pro;The disappearance of certain cultural segments and the appearance of new ones is one of the factors that enables cultural evolution.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;12
54;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.6;con;Countries with relatively high Human Development Index (HDI) ratings experience a demographic transition: fertility (defined as the number of children born by a woman over her lifetime) drops from around eight to near one and a half. As a UBI would further increase the HDI rating of a country (in particular the income per person aspect) this trend is likely to intensify.;['0', '4', '12', '2', '0']; ;9
55;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.6.1;pro;If rich countries generally have lower fertility rates, childcare costs are not the only factor decreasing fertility and thus a monetary increase like a UBI is unlikely to boost it.;['0', '0', '0', '1', '0']; ;10
56;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.6.2;con;This claim indirectly implies we should avoid developing countries (or reducing poverty) in order to increase the birth rates. This is barbaric.;['0', '1', '0', '2', '0']; ;10
57;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.6.3;con;One explanation of this phenomenon is the extensive entering of women into the the workplace. A UBI would mitigate the need for a job and enable women to focus on their motherhood, if wished. This could raise fertility rates again.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '1']; ;10
58;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.6.3.1;con;"The financial independence would allow women to pursue individual enrichment, such as gaining education, a desired career, an artistic pursuit, or travel opportunities.

62;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.6.3.2.1;con;"Exactly how many people enter the workforce because they want to? Since when is joining the capitalist system vs being a marginalized ""poor"" outcast, a choice?

63;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.7;con;The annual cost of raising a child is likely more than a base income of, for example, ten thousand dollars. Welfare policies give benefits to parents, but that happens only because governments acknowledge the immense cost that goes with it.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 4;9

65;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.7.2;con;A UBI is not meant to cover all familiar needs, but gives an incentive to parents that otherwise could not afford raising a child only with their jobs.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;10
66;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.7.3;con;Children would likely be included in a UBI. An extra income would cover many of the expenses related to a child.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;10
67;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.7.4;con;No welfare policy is given solely out of recognising immense costs. The government would not be financially incentivising something it does not want to encourage.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;10
68;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.7.4.1;con;Medicare and other provisions of healthcare are given out because the government recognizes the immense costs of healthcare for the elderly and disabled.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;11
69;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.1.8;con;Lower birth rates might be a better way of conserving resources especially among those with greater difficulty with job retention strengths.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;9
70;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.3;con;This is nothing but supposition.;['3', '0', '0', '2', '3']; ;8
71;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.4;con;This is assuming that UBI payments would be sent to underage citizens in a way that allows their parents to abuse it, as opposed to (for example) being held in trust and issued as a lump sum upon majority.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;8
72;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.5;con;A UBI is generally considered to be an amount that is paid to everybody, and everybody gets the same amount. It is not depended on individual circumstances.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '1']; ;8
73;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.5.1;con;And because this amount is unconditionally paid to everybody, also to children, a UBI creates an inherent incentive to give birth to many children. As legal guardians, parents can freely dispose of the children's UBI.;['0', '0', '1', '1', '0']; 3;9
74;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.6;con;Deliberately claiming another's money and using it against their best interests would constitute domestic abuse, which would be penalized and thus disincentivized.;['1', '1', '0', '0', '1']; ;8
75;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.6.1;con;Irresponsible use of children's UBI payments by parents is too hard to police properly.;['0', '0', '0', '1', '0']; ;9
76;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.6.1.1;con;Only if you give the child's UBI to the underage child or to their parents, instead of having it held in trust until they're old enough to make decisions about it.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;10
77;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.6.2;con;This would mean that a parent who buys food for their child (paid for partly by the child's UBI) would be commiting domestic abuse, which seems absurd. In practice, a UBI would probably allocate a children's income to their parents until they are 18 or not living at home.;['2', '0', '0', '1', '0']; 3;9

79;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.4.7;con;A UBI incentivises individuals to pursue their own individual aspirations by eliminating the barriers of poverty. Those who no longer envision their lives as being stuck in a multigenerational cycle of poverty would be less inclined to limit their options through an accidental pregnancy and less inclined to see the benefit of having a child when they could pursue their individual goals instead.;['1', '0', '0', '2', '0']; ;8

84;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.5.1.1.1;con;"The difficulties involved in hiding a death would rapidly make this infeasible - funerals, closure of accounts and estates, the deceased's disappearance from public and social life, grieving of friends and families, etc. would all be telltale signs. Furthermore, the steps necessary to conceal each of these things (even temporarily; they likely could not be hid indefinitely at all) would be unlikely and difficult for a grieving family to implement, even if deliberately pre-planned.";['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;10
85;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.5.1.1.1.1;con;If someone seriously wanted to do it (and with $10,000 annually on the line, there is indeed strong incentive for some people), it would not be too difficult to just hide someone's death by not publicizing it, and quietly disposing of the body (perhaps burying it in a private grave).;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;11

90;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.5.3.1.1;con;This would constitute financial abuse, which already happens with present-day pensions and disability and care payments. It is a separate issue, not an argument specifically against the UBI.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; 1;10
91;1.1.2.2.2.3.1.5.3.1.1.1;con;It is an argument specifically against the UBI because prevention methods would be less effective with UBI. That is to say, even if stronger laws/enforcement against this kind of financial abuse are enacted, the introduction of a UBI would increase the amount of financial abuse by making it far easier and widespread/applicable.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;11
