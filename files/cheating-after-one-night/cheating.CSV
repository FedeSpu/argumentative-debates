75;1.1.4.3.3.2.1.2.1.2.1;con;If a partner was worried by these signs, it is unlikely that they will be forgotten. This then has the potential to lead to confirmation bias in the future, even in relation to anomalies that are not actually linked to any cheating.;['0', '2', '4', '8', '2']; 7;10

94;1.1.4.3.7.2;pro;It could be in the interest of the other party that the relationship is ended. For example, the other party may have a wish to be exclusively in monogamous relationships.
