71;1.1.2.1.2.1.3.2.1;con;Pressuring Israel for a peace deal will likely alienate it as Israel does not want to recognise an independent Palestine. This risks destroying whatever gains have been made through backdoor and covert diplomacy.;['0', '5', '3', '6', '0']; ;8

73;1.1.2.1.2.1.3.4;con;While it might be that popular perception is not as important for state actors to the extent that they are non-democratic, it still influences many other aspects of national relations, since a nation is far more than simply its state.;['0', '1', '8', '2', '0']; 7;7
