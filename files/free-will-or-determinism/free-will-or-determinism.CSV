5;1.1.1.1.1.1;pro;"Without free will, the scientist cannot choose what conclusions to draw from these observations, but must conclude what she is determined to conclude. Therefore such conclusions cannot be trusted.

6;1.1.1.1.1.1.1;con;Predetermination does not invalidate the proven effectiveness of logic.

27;1.1.1.2.2.5.1;con;If the laws of nature are deterministic they leave only one way to act and thus no room to act.

34;1.1.1.2.5.1.1;pro;Saying that our understanding could one day shift to allow for the existence of free will is a poor argument. One could say the same thing about anything from telepathy to tarot reading.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']; ;6

36;1.1.1.2.6.1;con;Determinism is not required to negate any rational conception of free will. It's not relevant that the universe isn't deterministic. Random, non-deterministic events do not lend any support to the existence of free will.;['0', '0', '0', '0', '1']; ;5
