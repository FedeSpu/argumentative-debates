78;1.1.3.4.2;con;"Intersectionality has only existed for 30 years. Yet, the welfare of white, heterosexual people has been the standard for the vast majority of human history; those that do not adhere to traditional norms deserve an equitable voice as well.";['0', '0', '2', '1', '0']; ;4
79;1.1.3.4.2.1;pro;"The concept of ""whiteness"" was first used to claim superiority of the ""white race"" in the 1600s when the British introduced the concept of racism to the Americas during the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
